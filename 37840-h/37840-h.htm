<p><span class="smcap">My dear Judge O'Hagan,</span></p>

<p>During the vacation of last autumn I applied
myself to collecting as much information as possible concerning
the South Isles of Aran, which I had visited in
connection with the Land Commission in the previous
month of July. Pressure of business and a severe illness
compelled me to defer until recently the arranging of my
notes, which, in the hope that they may direct the attention
of those in power to the long neglected Islands, I
have resolved to publish, and I look on it as a good omen
of the success of my efforts that you have kindly allowed
me to dedicate my work to you, who have won so high a
place in law and in literature.</p>

<div class="sidenote">POPE GREGORY THE GREAT</div>

<p>The south isles of Aran, which shelter the Galway
bay from the heavy swell of the Atlantic, are Inishmore,
the large island, nine miles in length; Inishmaan, the
middle island, two and a half miles in length; Inisheer,
the lesser, two miles in length; Straw Island, upon
which the lighthouse stands, and the Brannock Rocks
or islands, all forming that group which to the west
bounds the Galway bay, and the ancient jurisdiction
of the Admiral of Galway. They lie in a line drawn
from the north-west to the south-east from Iar Connaught
to the county of Clare. Iar Connaught is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
separated from Inishmore, the largest and most
westerly island, by the North Sound, five and a half
miles wide, called by the natives <i>Bealagh-a-Lurgan</i>,
"Lough Lurgan way." Lough Lurgan was the
ancient name of a lake that formerly lay west of
Galway, and the tradition is that in the old times
before us&mdash;213 years from the Flood&mdash;the waters of
the Atlantic, sweeping in the full fury of their force
across the Aran barriers, united with the waters of
the lake and formed the Bay of Galway, leaving the
islands of Aran the towering remnants of the barriers
which were too strong even for the Atlantic billows to
carry away. Between Inishmore and Inishmaan is
Gregory's Sound, a mile and a half wide, called by
the natives <i>Bealagh-ne-Hayte</i>, "Hayte's way." The
present name was given to it by the monks, who
called the sound "Gregory," in honour of Pope
Gregory the Great, after he had converted or aided
in converting the Anglo-Saxons to the Christian faith.
Between the middle island, Inishmaan, and Inisheer,
the eastern and smallest island, is the "foul sound," four
miles wide; and between Inisheer and the county of
Clare is the "south sound," four miles wide. This
is the great waterway between "the old sea," as the
natives call the Atlantic, and the Bay of Galway.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MANOR OF IAR CONNAUGHT.</div>

<p>The sum of the lengths of the three islands and of
the two intervening sounds is eighteen miles. The
area of the entire group is 11,288 acres; poor law
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>valuation, &pound;1576; rent, &pound;2067; poor rate, a shilling
in the pound; average poor rate for ten years,
three shillings; population, 3118 Catholics, and 45
Protestants. Aran is in the Catholic archdiocese and
in the Protestant diocese of Tuam. In the islands
are three Catholic churches and one Protestant, two
priests, one parson, and one doctor, and there are
schools, schoolmasters, schoolmistresses, and scholars,
<i>et hoc genus omne</i>; and there is a petty sessions court,
and there are three police-barracks and eighteen
policemen. The fishing-boats or curraghs of the third
class, which are ribs covered with canvas, and worth
&pound;6 each, are 130 in number; of the second class
there are 34 boats, and of the first class there are
none. There are no paupers from the islands in the
workhouse, which is in Galway, and there is no workhouse
on the island; neither is there an auxiliary
workhouse, nor an hospital, nor an infirmary, nor a
midwife, nor a jail, nor grand jury works, though
there is a grand jury cess of &pound;34 12<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE ARAN MAIL-BOAT.</div>

<p>Of Inishmore, or the great island, Kilronan is the
capital&mdash;a village with a good hotel. Killeany was
the ancient capital, formerly the residence of the lords
of the manor of Iar Connaught. The other places
of note are Oghil, Onaght, Bungowla, Kilmurry, Dun
&AElig;ngus, Dun Eochla, Dubh Chathair or the black fort.
So also on that island are the ruins of the churches of
Tempul Benin with its rectangular enclosures and group<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
of cells, of Tempul Brecan and Cross, of Tempul Beg
Mac Dara, of Tempul More Mac Dara, of Tempul
Assurniadhe, of Tempul-an-cheathrair-Aluin, and of
St. Enda and the ruins of the seven churches.</p>

<p>On the middle island of Inishmaan are the ruins of
the fortresses of Dun Chona and Dunfarbagh, and the
villages, five in number. On the eastern island of
Inisheer are St. Gobnet's chapel, Ballyhees, Largi,
Furmina, Trawkera, near which there is a lake a
quarter of a mile in circumference and of great depth,
which might be converted into a useful harbour by
cutting an entrance into it through the rocky shore.</p>

<p>The harbour of Kilronan is spacious, but not fitted
for vessels of heavy tonnage. A pier of four or five
hundred yards is built out into the sea, alongside of
which was moored during the tempestuous days of
the last week of July (1886) her Majesty's mail-boat&mdash;a
large-sized sailing yacht, provided with a cabin and
forecastle, and manned by a remarkably civil and
obliging crew. But it is to be lamented that no steamer
has as yet been placed on the line between Galway
and Aran, in consequence of which, frequently for four
or five days, communication with the mainland becomes
impossible. Letters remained unanswered, and newspapers
remained unread; so that nation might rise
against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, but the
islanders in happy repose, undisturbed by the postman
or by the magnetic wire, would in their isles of peace<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
have happily lived on in blissful ignorance of the painful
turmoils that reigned around.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE BLACK-EYED HEB&Egrave;.</div>

<p>At the hotel the tourist will be served with a homely
and wholesome fare&mdash;prime veal and sweet and
tender mutton, for the Aran herbage is renowned
for the tenderness of the meat that it produces. At
dinner a bottle of the mountain-dew, with a smell
as divine as it is illegal, may be by accident produced;
and for all this, when the guest requests that he might
be informed of the charges, the reply ten to one will
be, "Oh, anything your honour likes to give!"&mdash;at
least, such was said by the black-eyed Heb&egrave; who
ministered to the wants of the writer of these pages.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE FLORA OF ARAN.</div>

<p>The Aran landscape as your vessel approaches from
Galway is a peculiar one&mdash;peculiar to Aran. From
the soft sea beach on the Galway side of the island,
which varies in breadth from one to four miles across,
slope fields of bare rocks terrace over terrace, sometimes
nine in number, until they reach the topmost
cliff on the south-west or ocean side hundreds of feet
over the Atlantic. This terraced landscape has the
appearance of being a barren and rocky wilderness;
but on closer inspection threads of fresh green herbages
can be traced in the cleavages and deeply cut fissures
of the rocks, and it is in those cleavages that the
richest profusion of botanical specimens are to be
found. The cleft upon which we stood was teeming
with purple heather, foxglove, scarlet geranium, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
wild thyme, with the golden leaf of the variegated
ivy; the crimson berries of the orchis and the red
fruit of the wild strawberry forming a rich contrast to
the delicate blue of the forget-me-not. Here, too,
were the harebell and speedwell, fringed with the
delicate frond of the maidenhair fern. In other
clefts was the richness of the white and red clover,
intermingled with a variety of medicinal herbs, amongst
which were the wild garlic and the kenneen or fairy
flax, much relied on for its medicinal qualities. In
several of the localities in the islands the tormentil
root, which serves in place of bark for tanning, and
another plant which gives a fine blue dye and which
the islanders use in colouring woollen cloths manufactured
by them for their own wear, are to be found.
The Aran isles contain many rare plants; but, owing
to the absence of turf bogs and scarcity of damp
ground, there are neither marshy nor heathy plants,
nor sedges, nor rushes. Even so, the flora of Aran is
decidedly rich. On the hillsides are a great variety
of flowering plants indigenous to the soil, which
blossom at different times of the year. In the rocky
dells there are several kinds of convolvulus of very
rich florescence. The Madagascar periwinkle seems
to be perfectly acclimatized and blossoms profusely,
and we were happy to find an abundant growth of
hops, the introduction of which is ascribed to the
monks of the olden time.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">ORNITHOLOGY OF ARAN.</div>

<p>The tillage of the islands comprises potatoes,
mangold wurzel, vetches, rape, clover, oats, and barley.
The potatoes almost exclusively planted are "the
Protestants;" and a Protestant tourist unarmed felt
somewhat alarmed at the startling intelligence that
"dinner would be ready as soon as the Protestants
that were on the gridiron would be roasted." The
dinner brought up, need it be told that our Anglican
friend enjoyed the joke of our witty waitress quite as
much as we ourselves did?</p>

<div class="sidenote">TANKS WANTING IN ARAN.</div>

<p>The crops are greatly devastated by caterpillars and
grubs. The abundance of these pernicious insects is
attributed to the great scarcity of sparrows and other
small birds. Starlings are seldom seen; but never a
swallow. Sea gulls are numerous, and amongst the
sea birds the osprey or sea eagle is a conspicuous
object. Neither the raven, rook, crow, nor jackdaw
visits the islands; but there is a handsome bird which
is very numerous, especially in the north island. The
chough, which, in addition to plumage dark and
glossy like that of the jackdaw, displays a beak and
legs of bright scarlet. It is said that this bird was
formerly to be seen in flocks on various parts of the
English coasts, and that now it cannot be found in
any part of the United Kingdom except in Aran.
Plovers, gannets, pigeons, duck, teal, and divers breed
abundantly on the rocky ledges. The cliffs are the
resort of countless puffins (<i>Anas Leucopsis</i>); the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
popular belief being that they spring from the driftwood<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>.
Their flesh supplies a rich lamp oil, and
their feathers fetch a high price in the London
markets. The capture of these birds is a dangerous
occupation for the cragsmen, who descend from
the cliffs by means of a rope to the haunts of the
puffin, and having spent the night in the dangerous
occupation, ensnaring and killing them as they
sleep on the rocky ledges, they are hauled up in
the morning, having realized ten or twelve shillings
during the night. In the summer of 1816, two unfortunate
fellows engaged in this frightful occupation
missed their footing, and falling, were dashed to pieces
on the rocks below. The solitary bittern, called in
Irish the <i>Boonaun-Laynagh</i>, frequents the low-lying
ground on the Galway side of the island, and hares
and rabbits are very plentiful also. On the barren
sheets of rocks the peasants (denominated lazy and
idle, by lazy and idle writers and speakers) have with
tireless toil walled in and made numberless gardens
in which potatoes mealy and dry are grown. The
meteorological aspirations of the Aran peasant are
for rain, diametrically the opposite of what their
brethren on the mainland desire. A dry summer
gives to Aran a parched and burnt-up hue, when the
cattle faint and die if not removed to the mainland.
Tanks, such as they have in Ceylon, are sadly wanting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
in those islands, and the expense of their construction
must be a trifling matter indeed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ICE-CUT FURROWS.</div>

<p>One of the most remarkable features in the conformation
of Inishmore is, that between the overlapping
strata or terraces of limestone, thirty-seven
feet in thickness in some places and eighteen in others,
are beds of shale. The highest of the terraces is
320 feet over high-water mark, on the perpendicular
cliff overlooking the Atlantic. On the sixth lowest
of these descending steps the village of Kilronan, the
capital of the island, over against the Galway bay, is
built, and under that terrace and over the seventh is
a shale bed which contains the water supply for the
glebe and upper village wells.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BOULDERS.</div>

<p>Those who delight in geological speculations will
find in these isles much to interest them. Here are
deep furrows in the hard rocks, cut as they say by
passing icebergs. One of these ice-cut furrows may be
seen near the shore of Killeany Bay, about two hundred
yards north-east of Lough Atalia, and a quarter
of a mile from Kilronan. It is about seven yards long,
nearly a yard wide, having a bearing of east by north.
Though the icebergs have left their stri&aelig;, and though
their passage is marked by the deep furrows cut by
them as they moved, nevertheless the patches of boulder
drift on the surface are few; but the bergs in their
passage from the north district did drop some huge
metamorphic rocks, not one of which is indigenous, so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
to speak, to the islands, but have been carried from a
district such as that of Oughterard. Strange that some
limestone boulders have also been dropped, carried
from some far-off limestone district. These boulders
have withstood the wreck of ages, but the weather-beaten
rocks under them are so worn as here
and there to present the appearance of pedestals
bearing up the superincumbent masses. Whilst there
is much to arrest the attention as you look from the
hotel windows towards Galway over the Galway bay,
bounded on the north by the grotesque desolation of
the Connemara mountains, and on the south by the
rocky mountains of the county of Clare, it is on the
south-west side of the islands of Aran that the scene
is awfully sublime, terrific, and impressive&mdash;rendered
more awful by reason of the confusion of the waters
and of the roaring of the waves of the sea. The heavy
swell of the Atlantic there rolls in angry billows
against the cliffs dark and perpendicular, hundreds of
feet in height&mdash;cliffs perforated by winding caverns
worn by the violence of the waves, from one of which,
having an aperture in the surface, was projected a
column of water to the height of a ship's mast. Whilst
many of these cliffs rise perpendicularly from the
ocean, many of them have sea terraces or steps at foot
below the high-water mark. At <i>Illaun-a-naur</i>, on
the south-easterly side of the great island, are sea-terraced
cliffs which are fendered by a rampart formed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
of enormous blocks of limestone upheaved from the
depths of the ocean and hurled with violence on the
rampart which now forms a foot barrier against
the further encroachment of the Atlantic.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SEA WEEDS.</div>

<p>The seaweeds around the Aran islands are peculiarly
fitted for the production and manufacture of kelp, of
which there are two varieties, one made from the
black weed, and the other from the red. The black
usually grows above the low-water mark of the neap-tide,
whilst all the red grows below it. The red
weed kelp is the most valuable, as in general it gives
salts containing iodine. Marine plants, such as the
sea-anemones, the rock-grown samphire, and the sea-cabbage
grow around the islands in great profusion.</p>

<p>Another remarkable feature in Aran is the enormous
amount of fine quartzose&mdash;moving sands which, blown
in thick clouds by the winds, fill the nooks and corners
and crevices of the islands. These sands, which are
said to possess the property of preserving bodies
uncorrupted after death, might be fixed and utilized
in the same manner as the sands of Arcachon on the
west coast of France have been fixed and utilized,
by planting therein vast forests of the <i>Pinus maritima</i>,
the interlacery of whose roots would do the twofold
duty of fixing the sands and creating a soil enriched
by the amount of nitrogen therein digested and deposited.
At Trawmore, on the south of Killeany Bay,
proofs have lately been discovered not only of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
movement of the sand-hills, but also of the appearance
of fields and buildings submerged on the sea-coast.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MOVING SANDS IN ARAN.</div>

<p>These islands in prehistoric times must have suffered
much from the convulsions which then shook the
world&mdash;in later times they appear to have suffered
little, though Richard Kirwan the chemist relates that
in his memory, in the year 1774, a fearful thunderstorm
visited Inishmore, when a granite block of
enormous dimensions, called the "Gregory," was
struck by lightning, shattered to atoms, and flung into
the sea.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE DRUIDS.</div>

<p>The "remnants of things that have passed away" are
many on these islands. In no other part of the
United Kingdom are there confined in spaces so
narrow so many monuments of Pagan times; here are
evidences of two great ages of civilization&mdash;that of the
Druids and that of the Christians; but, whether of the
Druids or of the Christians, Aran had been the retreat
in early times of the contemplative and the learned.
Sequestered and undisturbed, the natives have even to
this day preserved much of the moral and physical
remains of the ancient world.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DRUIDISM.</div>

<p>The Aranites in their
simplicity consider the remains of the Druids as inviolable,
being as they fondly imagine the enchanted
haunts and property of aerial beings, whose power of
doing mischief they greatly dread and studiously propitiate.
The natives believe that the "cairns" or
circular mounds are the sepulchres of the mighty men<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
of old, men of renown, whose acts and deeds even
now are celebrated in songs sung at the cottage firesides
by minstrels to the strings of the wandering
harper: on every lip are the exploits of Churcullen,
of Gol, son of Morna, of Oscar, and of Ossian,
and here are pointed out the places where they lived
and died. We have also the immense "cromlechs"
or altar flags, supported on perpendicular pillars, as we
may venture to call the unhammered stones of about
three feet in height, whilst under those "cromlechs"
still rest the remains of heroes whose faithful dogs
interred with them bear them company even in death.
Here, too, no bad memory is retained of the sacred
fires of Bal (another name for the sun), which were
kept burning; for the sun, and the moon, and the
stars were by them reverenced; but the sun of the
Druids was supposed to be the most noble type
of the Godhead&mdash;the most glorious object of the
material creation. The mysterious stones, twelve in
number, encircling the altars of sacrifice, sometimes
said to be zodiacal rings, after the twelve signs of the
zodiac, are here frequently to be found. The purifying
ordeals the cattle were subject to at Aran until a very
late period are yet there remembered. The sacred
fires on the first day of each of the quarters blazed
from cairn to cairn, amid prayers for the fruits of the
earth, and even yet, on St. John's Eve in June, huge
bonfires are lighted near every village through the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
island, for the holy flame was considered essential to
the cattle as a preservative from contagious disorders.
The Druids kindled after their manner two immense
fires, with great incantations, close to each other, whilst
between those fires the cattle were driven, and if they
escaped unharmed it was considered as auspicious
as it would be inauspicious for man and beast to be
therein harmed, and hence the saying, "Placed between
the two fires of Baal." Concerning the mysteries of
their religion, the Druids did not commit them to
writing, and therefore it is that so little is known of
their teachings or of what they taught, and what they
did teach is said by some to have been taught in
the Greek language, "to the end," writes Sir Edward
Coke, "that their discipline might not be made so
common amongst the vulgar, nay more, their very
names and appellations may serve as a proof of their
use of the Greek tongue, they being called Druids
from [Greek: Drys], an oak, because, saith Pliny, they frequent
the woods where oaks are, and in all their sacrifices
they use the leaves of those trees."<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">SIR EDWARD COKE ON DRUIDISM.</div>

<p>With Druidism departed the forests of the ilex and
the quercus from Aran. May we venture to hope
that, in the coming changes, Aran may once more be
re-afforested, and that the islanders, who have now no
coal, no timber, and no turf to burn, may have at least
timber to burn in great abundance in the near future?</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">FORTRESSES OF ARAN.</div>

<p>The immense fortresses on the islands are said to be
the finest specimens of barbaric military structures
extant in Europe. Built by the pagan Firbolgs in the
first century of the Christian era, these mortarless
walls, Cyclopean as they are called, having braved the
tempests of nineteen hundred years, still stand. On
the large island, and within four miles of our hotel,
is Dun &AElig;ngus, which, covering many acres, is on a
precipice hundreds of feet in height. This fortress,
in the form of a horse-shoe, is unapproachable on the
sea side, where the Atlantic surges heavily against the
solid rock, whose surfaces are seamed, and scarred,
and torn by the violence of the billows driven against
them by the winter tempests. Unapproachable by an
enemy from the sea, it is equally unapproachable by
an enemy from the land, the only entrance thereto
being by a narrow avenue skirting the edge of the
cliff. The fortress consists of three enclosures, the
inner, the middle, and the outer. The inner
measures 160 feet, on what may be called the axis
major from north to south of the horse-shoe on the
ground plan, whilst along the cliff it measures 144
feet. The mortarless wall which surrounds this inmost
enclosure is about 1100 feet from end to end, by
18 feet in height, and 12 feet in thickness. Now
this one wall is made up of three walls, each four feet
thick, one against the other, like the coats of an
onion, which arrangement occurs in the middle and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
outside enclosures, and which has this advantage,
that if an enemy should succeed in breaking down the
exterior envelope, he would find behind it a new face
of masonry, instead of the easily disturbed loose
interior of a dry stone wall. The space between this
inner and the next outside, or middle enclosure, is
perfectly clear, leaving ample scope for military
man&oelig;uvres. The outside wall, which is almost an
ellipse, encloses about eleven acres, all studded over
with an army of white pointed stones, set slope-wise
into the earth, like almonds on a plum-pudding,
save where a narrow avenue is left, so that no
assailing force could possibly approach the second
wall, without having its ranks broken by those intricate
piles which answer the <i>chevaux-de-frise</i> of modern
fortifications. The doorway with sloping jambs of
Egyptian pattern through the outer wall admits only
one or two assailants together.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DUN &AElig;NGUS.</div>

<p>Dun Conor, an oval fort on the middle island, is
much larger than Dun &AElig;ngus, of which we have just
been speaking, the axis major of Dun Conor
measuring 227 feet. It also stands on a high cliff,
and its dry and mortarless walls are built also on the
coat of the onion principle.</p>

<p>Inisheer, the eastern island, contains a circular Dun
called Creggan-keel. Furmena Castle, also on this
island, was, in later times, the stronghold of the
O'Briens&mdash;lords of the islands of Aran&mdash;and upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
these islands are many more fortresses. There is,
on the north side of Inishmore, Dun Onaght, a
circular Firbolgic fort, measuring 92 feet across; and
on the south-west side, <i>Dubh Cahn</i>, "the black fort,"
a Dun or fortress of very rude masonry, of enormous
thickness, and overlooking the cliffs.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ST. ENDA.</div>

<p>The Christian remains of the islands are many, and
many are the names of the saints still remembered
who congregated here in the early days of Irish
Christianity. Amongst those remarkable heroes of
the Cross, none appears to have been greater than
St. Enda, who has left his name everywhere in the
islands. To him, indeed, is due much of the success
that followed the footsteps of those missionaries who
won, in the course of centuries, for Aran the appellation
of "Aran of the Saints." Enda was the only son of
Conel, King of Oriel, whose territories included the
modern counties of Louth, Armagh, and Fermanagh.
This Enda had, however, several sisters, the elder
being the wife of the King of Cashel, whose death
is chronicled in the annals of the Four Masters as
of the year 489; the younger was Fancha, the abbess
of an abbey, or nunnery, wherein were educated
ladies of the court, amongst whom was one remarkable
for her great mental and personal attractions. Enda
loved her, and hoped that she would one day share
with him the glories, such as they were, of the throne
of his fathers. His love for his affianced bride amounted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
to an idolatry, but his idolatry must end, and his idol
must die an early death. The abbess brought him
weeping into the chamber where the corpse of his
loved one was laid. Fancha then reminded him of
how favour is deceitful and how beauty is vain, and
how the day, dim and remote, would still come when
he would be as his affianced bride now was. "Love
not the world, nor the things that are in the world!"
exclaimed the abbess with a vehemence that her
earnestness inspired. That world was then abjured,
and straightway he entered a religious order, that of
the Regular Canons of St. Augustine, and after years
of study and probation, was ordained priest in Rome.
He thence returned to the kingdom of Oriel in
Ireland, where he built several churches. Having
visited his sister and her husband the King of Cashel,
the latter was, after much hesitation, persuaded to
confer upon God and upon Enda the islands of Aran.
Possession of a place so retired and so suited to study
and contemplation being thus obtained, Enda introduced
there a multitude of holy men, monks to live
like the Essenes of old, a contemplative life. He
divided the islands into ten parts, and built ten
monasteries, each under the rule of its proper superior;
whilst he chose a place for his own residence on the
eastern coast of the western island of Inishmore, and
there erected a monastery, the name and site of which
are preserved even to this day in the little village of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
Killeany (Kil-Enda), about a mile from Kilronan.
Half the island was assigned to this monastery, and
multitudes from afar flocked to Aran, which became
the home of the learned and the pious.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ST. BRENDAN.</div>

<p>Amongst
the remarkable men that there clustered, were St.
Kieran, founder of Clonmacnoise, who died in 549,
and St. Brendan. The history of the latter abounds
with fable, but it is admitted that a thousand years
before Christopher Columbus, he crossed the Atlantic
and landed on the coast of Florida, where there is
a strip of country which, according to Humboldt, in
his Cosmos, bore the name of <i>Irland it Milka</i>,
"Ireland of the white man." The visit of St.
Brendan to Aran, previous to his departure to the
great western continent, has been described by one
of the most musical of our poets&mdash;Denis Florence
MacCarthy&mdash;as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote">ST. FURSA.</div>

<p>Amongst the other ecclesiastical notabilities that
frequented Aran in the sixth century was St. Fursa,
whose life has been written by scores of writers, as
well by the Venerable Bede as by Archbishop Usher,
the greatest ornament of the Protestant Church in
Ireland. The visions of Fursa were, we are informed
by the Rev. J. Carey, in his admirable translation of
Dante, the groundwork of the <i>Inferno</i>. The beautiful
imagery of Fursa's fancy, which threw a charm over
every subject that he handled, may be well illustrated
by his rhapsodies on seeing for the first time the city
of Rome, as staff in hand he wended his way to the
Eternal City. Falling on his knees, with outstretched
arms, he exclaimed, "Rome! oh, Rome! I hail thee,
admirable by apostolic triumphs. Rome, decorated
by the roses of the martyrs, whitened by the lilies of
the confessors, crowned by the palms of the virgins,
thou that containest the bones and relics of the saints,
may thy authority never fade!"<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Strange, is it not, that
the first sight of the city of Rome should produce in
the minds of men feelings which words almost fail to
convey!</p>

<div class="sidenote">GIBBON.</div>

<p>It was eleven hundred years after Fursa's first
salutation to the city of Rome that Edward Gibbon,
when musing amid the ruins of the Capitol whilst
the barefooted friars were singing vespers in the
temple of Jupiter, formed the idea of writing "The
Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire," and what his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
feelings were on seeing for the first time the holy city
he thus in that immortal work informs us: "My
temper is not very susceptible of enthusiasm, and the
enthusiasm which I do not feel I have ever scorned
to affect, but at the distance of twenty-five years, I
can neither forget nor express the strong emotions
which agitated my mind as I first approached and
entered the Eternal City. After a sleepless night I
trod with a lofty step the ruins of the Forum." St.
Fursa, returning on foot through France, died at
Peronne, and his body was conveyed to the island of
Aran, where amongst his <i>quondam</i> brethren he now,
awaiting the resurrection of the just, reposes.</p>

<p>Of the monuments, as well pre-Christian as Christian,
in these islands, there are twenty-one, vested in the
secretary of the Commissioners of Public Works in
Ireland, to be preserved as national monuments.

<div class="sidenote">RUINS.</div>

<p>Ruins everywhere meet the eye of the tourist in
Aran&mdash;ruined abbeys, ruined monasteries, ruined nunneries,
ruined cells, ruined churches, ruined schools,
ruined forts, ruined forests, and ruined towers. With
one exception the churches of Aran face the east. I
heard somewhere, when on the islands, that that is
not exactly true, but that they faced the point of the
compass at which the sun rose on the day that the
foundation stone was laid. Be that as it may, there
is the Oratory of St. Banon, which directly faces the

<div class="sidenote">CLOGHAUNS.</div>

<p>Close by are the remains of the hermitage, partly sunk
in the rock, and of some cloghauns, or stone-roofed
dwellings. How those solitaries, who for centuries
held up the lamp of learning which shone across
Europe during the long night which followed the
breaking up of the Roman empire, could live in such
comfortless cells, it is impossible to apprehend:
circular chambers about twenty feet in exterior
diameter, with a hole in the stone beehive roof for a
chimney, and with an Egyptian-like doorway that a
tall man could with difficulty enter. <i>Teampul-Chiarain</i>
has a beautiful eastern window, with some
crosses. Four miles from Kilronan are Kilmurvey
and <i>Teampul McDuach</i>, a sixth-century church, consisting
of nave and choir in beautiful preservation.
There are windows there of remote antiquity, with
lintels formed of two leaning stones; and there is
a semicircular window of great beauty of a more
recent date. There is a stone leaning against the
eastern gable with a rudely cut opening which seems
to have been the head of the more ancient window.
The narrow doorway is like the entrance to an
Egyptian tomb. Another small church, <i>Teampul-beg</i>,
together with a holy well and monastic enclosure, is
worthy of inspection. At the north-western side of
the Inishmore island, and six miles from Kilronan,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
are the remains of the seven churches, one of which
is called <i>Teampul Brecain</i>&mdash;the church of St. Braccan,
who was the founder of the monastery of Ardbraccan,
now the cathedral church of the diocese of Meath.
The ruined church of <i>Teampul-saght-Machree</i> is an
object of interest on the middle island. The eastern
island in ancient times was called <i>Aran-Coemhan</i> in
honour of <i>St. Coemhan</i> (St. Kevin), brother of St.
Kevin of Glendalough. He was one of the most
renowned of the saints of Aran, and is believed to
have not unfrequently abated storms after being
piously invoked.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CHILDLESS MARRIAGES.</div>

<p>There is a legend in the islands
worthy of remembrance by those whose marriages are
as yet unblest with children. We speak of that of
St. Braccan's bed, where many a fair devotee has
prayed and has had her prayers granted, as Anna of
old had in the temple of Silo,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> when the Lord bestowed
on her childless marriage a child who was afterwards
the prophet Samuel.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ARAN CHURCHES.</div>

<p>The churches are all of small dimensions&mdash;never
more than sixty feet in length&mdash;at the eastern end of
which is not unfrequently a chancel in which the altar
was placed. Between the nave of the church and the
chancel was the chancel arch of a semicircular form,
a very beautiful specimen of which exists in the
Protestant cathedral of Tuam. These temples, very
imperfectly lighted by small windows splaying inwards,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
do not appear to have ever been glazed. The chancel
had usually two or three windows&mdash;one of which is
always in the centre of the east end, with another in
the south wall, another in the south wall of the nave,
sometimes, though rarely, two in number. The
windows are frequently triangular-headed, but more
usually arched semicircularly, whilst the doorway is
almost universally covered by a horizontal lintel
consisting of a single stone. In all cases the sides
of the doorways incline like the doorways in the
old Cyclopean buildings, to which they bear a
striking resemblance. The smaller churches were
usually roofed with stone, whilst the larger ones were
roofed with wood covered with thatch. The wells are
carefully preserved, the scarcity of water rendering the
possession of a well almost as precious to them as to
the Eastern shepherds in the days of Rebecca.</p>

<p>The Aran churches, it must be admitted, have little
in them to interest the mind or captivate the senses;
nevertheless, in their symmetrical simplicity, their
dimly lighted naves, in the total absence of everything
that could distract attention, there is an expression
of fitness for their purpose too often wanting
in modern temples of the highest pretensions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LIVES OF THE MONKS.</div>

<p>The
monastic establishments close by contained little that
would savour of luxury. The cells of the friars were
low, narrow huts, built of the roughest materials,
which formed, by the regular distribution of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
streets, a large and populous village, enclosing within
a common wall a church and hospital, perhaps
a library. The austere inmates slept on the ground,
on a hard mat or a rough blanket, and the same
bundle of palm leaves, served them as a seat by day
and a pillow by night. The brethren were supported
by their manual labour, and the duty of labour was
strenuously recommended as a penance, as an exercise,
and as the most laudable means of securing their daily
subsistence. "<i>Laborare est orare</i>" was a monastic
maxim. The garden and the fields which the industry
of the monks had rescued from the forest or
the morass were cultivated by their ceaseless toil.
In the evening they assembled for vocal or mental
prayer, and they were awakened by a rustic horn,
or by the convent bell in the night, for the public
worship of the monastery. Even sleep, the last
refuge of the unhappy, was rigorously measured; and
it was to lives of self-denial like this that great
multitudes in the first century of the Christian era
betook themselves. Pliny, who lived when Christ was
crucified, surveyed with astonishment the monks of
the first century, "a solitary people," he says, "who
dwelt amongst the palm trees near the Dead Sea, who
increased, and who subsisted without money, who
fled from the pleasures of life, and who derived from
the disgust and repentance of mankind a perpetual
supply of voluntary associates."<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">ORDNANCE SURVEY.</div>

<p>On Inisheer island is a signal tower, and near it
is an old castle on an eminence. Here is shown the
"bed of St. Coemhan," much famed for its miraculous
cures. On the south-west point is a lighthouse
showing a light one hundred and ten feet in height.
It is stated in the <i>Leabhar-braec</i> that one of the Popes
was interred in the great island of Aran. The same
is repeated in one of the volumes of the Ordnance
Survey, a work which, never printed, is stowed away
on the shelves of the Royal Irish Academy, liable
at any moment to be destroyed by a conflagration.
In the three or four volumes on the county of Galway
are contained, and in the English language, the
inquisitions of Elizabeth, the subsequent patents of
James I., and much learning touching tithes, fisheries,
abbeys, abbey lands, priories, and monasteries, as
well as letters on these subjects between Petrie and
O'Donovan and other antiquarians employed on that
survey.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1308. The trade of Galway, which at the time
of the Anglo-Norman invasion in the twelfth century
was at zero, rapidly rose to a comparatively high
figure in the fourteenth century. In 1300 the customs
receipts were &pound;24 15<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i> at that port, and in 1392,
&pound;118 5<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i> This augured well for the progressive
improvement of the town; but that improvement was
blasted for a season by the appearance in the bay of
a fleet of pirates who swept the ships from the seas.
The merchants applied to their powerful neighbour,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
Dermot More O'Brien, lord of the isles of Aran, to
succour them in their straits; and for that succour and
the protection which he agreed to give them they
agreed to pay him yearly twelve tuns of wine; the
trade, commerce, and harbour of the town to be
protected, and otherwise by him and his successors
defended, from all and every attack of pirates and
privateers whatsoever, to which intent and purpose,
and for the considerations aforesaid, he covenanted
and agreed to maintain a suitable maritime force.
This Dermot More O'Brien was descended from
Brian [Boru] Boroimhe, slain at the battle of Clontarf
in 1014.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1334. In this year the islands were plundered
by Sir John Darcy, who sailed with fifty-six ships
around the Irish coasts.</p>

<div class="sidenote">REVOLT OF ARAN.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1400. The rebellion of the Mayo and Clanrickarde
Burkes in the province of Connaught, consequent
on the murder, in 1333, of William De Burgh,
Earl of Ulster and fifth Lord of Connaught, caused
the overthrow for nearly two hundred years, of the
English power in that province. The town of Galway,
oscillating in its allegiance between the Crown and
the Clanricardes, joined that powerful family against
Henry IV., and in their revolt they were joined by the
South Isles of Aran.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ROYAL LICENSE.</div>

<p>Thereupon the King did by
royal license permit certain persons to attack the
rebels in the said island, which license is as follows:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

its allegiance, the above license was in the same year
revoked.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE REFORMATION.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1485. A monastery was built in this year on
the great island for the Franciscans of the strict
observance; but this community was doomed to be
short lived, for the word had gone forth from Henry
VIII. to suppress the monasteries and they were
suppressed; and the annalists thus, in the Annals of
the Four Masters, <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1537, chronicle not alone
their overthrow, but the spread of a new religion in
England, "A new heresy and error arose in England
through pride, vain-glory, avarice, sensuality, and
many strange speculations, so that the people of
England went into opposition to the Pope and to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
Rome. They have demolished the abbeys, sold their

that has not been completely destroyed."</p>


<div class="sidenote">A STORM.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1560. A tragic occurrence occurred in this
year when Teige O'Brien, lord of the isles, was
returning, loaded with booty if not with honours, to
Aran, from a plundering expedition which he had
made into Munster; from one of the seaports of
which province he had the rashness with his homeward
bound barque to put to sea when a tempest was
said by his sailors to be impending. Deceived by
the "calm before the storm" he insisted on weighing
anchor. It was weighed, and as the starless night was
closing and deepening around him, the gale freshened
as he advanced&mdash;his tempest-tossed vessel struggled
amidst the waves, for the wind was high against it&mdash;and
when the morning rolled the clouds away, a
broken spar, an oarless boat, were all that remained
to tell the ghastly tale, that every hand on board was
lost. At the entrance of the Great Man's Bay, which
was far out of their course, is even now shown the
spot where on that fatal night they perished.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1570. Morchowe O'Brien, in consideration of
a sum of money to him in hand paid, conveyed these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
islands by way of mortgage to James Lynch Fitz
Ambrose and his heirs.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE O'BRIENS.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1575. In June of this year it was agreed
between the mortgagor and mortgagee of the islands
"that in case the sept of clan Tiege O'Brien, the said
mortgagor, should decease and perish, then that James
Lynch Fitz Ambrose, the mortgagee, should be their
sole heir, and possess, Aran, and all other their lands,
and that said O'Brien should not alienate or mortgage
any part or parcel of Aran to any person without the
mortgagee's consent and license." It appears, however,
that Tieg Eturgh, Morchowe Morowe, Conchor McMurchowe,
Terrilagh Meeagh, Tieg McTerrilagh, Dermot
McMurchowe, Tieg McTerrilagh Oge, and Conchor
McMoriertagh, McBrene, gentlemen, all of Aran, and
Dermot McCormick McConnor, of the Castle of
Trowmore, afterwards on July 14, 1575, appointed
Captain Morchowe McTerrilagh O'Brien their attorney
for ransoming the isles of Aran from James Lynch,
that all such parts as he should so ransom should
belong to him (O'Brien) and his heirs for ever.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>It would appear that this Captain Morchowe
McTerrilagh O'Brien, of the Clantiege of Aran, on July
14 of the same year, 1575, was in Galway; and being
there, was minded to claim the privilege his ancestors
had, he alleged, enjoyed of lodgings and meals for two
days and two nights in the town, and the "mayor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
calling before him auncient old credibel witnesses,
they declared upon their oaths that they never
heard of their parents or saw the said sept have
no more than two meals in the town, and it was
thereupon ordered that said sept shall have no more
than two meals, they being always bound to serve
attend and wait upon us and in our service as
their ancestors had been, and further that it was
the O'Brien sept that was bound to give lodging
and entertainment to all the commons of Galway,
when they shall repair to the islands of Aran. And
the said mayor did grant and promise O'Brien to be
aiders, helpers, maintainers and assisters, of him
against all persons that would lay siege to spoil the
islands or castle of Aran or otherwise wrong the said
Morchowe or his sept."<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE CLANRICARDES.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1579. Queen Elizabeth, by her charter to the
town of Galway, having recited that Richard III., late
King of England, out of his abundant grace and for
the greater security and safeguard of the town of
Galway, willed and ordained that neither MacWilliam
Burke, Lord of Clanricarde, nor his heirs, should have
any rule or power in the said town of Galway, therein
to act, exact, receive, ordain, or dispose of anything
without the special license, and by the assent and
superintendence of the mayor, bailiffs, and commonalty
of the said town of Galway; appointed the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
mayor of Galway to be admiral of her and her
successors within the town aforesaid and within and
over the islands of Aran and from the said islands to
Galway.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1580. There died in this year in the islands of
Aran an islander who had reached the extreme old
age of two hundred and twenty years. This patriarchal
inhabitant killed a bullock in his own house every year
for one hundred and eighty years.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE FEROCIOUS O'FLAHERTIES.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1586. In this year the O'Briens, long the
lords of the islands of Aran, "were expulsed from their
territory by ye ferocious O'Flaherties of Iar Connaught."
The matter was brought under the knowledge of the
Crown, who resolved to put an end to the lawless
savagery which existed in those parts, whereby one
sept could, in times of peace, sail on a plundering
expedition against another and expel them, wasting
the country with fire and sword all the time; and
accordingly a commission, under the great seal, was
issued for the purpose of examining the title, if any,
of the O'Flaherties to the islands. Having gone
through the mockery of an inquisition, the commissioners
found that the islands belonged not to the
O'Briens, lords of the isles, nor yet to the O'Flaherties,
who had no title at all, but that they belonged
to her Majesty Queen Elizabeth in right of
her crown and dignity; and accordingly she, by her
letters patent dated January 15th, <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1587, instead<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
of restoring them to the ancient proprietors, granted
them entire to Sir John Rawson, of Athlone, gentleman,
and his heirs, on condition that he should retain
constantly on the islands twenty foot-soldiers of the
English nation.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">CLAN OF MAC TIEGE O'BRIEN.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1588. When the return of the inquisition
and subsequent patent granting the lands away from
the O'Briens became known, the corporation of
Galway thus petitioned the Queen, in favour of
Murrough McTurlogh O'Brien: "That the Mac
Tieges of Aran, his ancestors, were under her Majesty
and her predecessors the temporal captains or lords
of the islands of Aran, and held their territories
and hereditaments elsewhere under the name of Mac
Tiege O'Brien of Aran, time out of man's memory,
and that they the said corporation, had seen the said
Murrough McTurlogh authorized by all his sept, as
chief of that name, and in possession of the premises
as his own lawful inheritance, as more at large doth
appear in our books of record, wherein he continued
until of late he was, by the usurping power of the
O'Flaherties expelled; and we say, moreover, that
the sept of the Mac Tiege O'Briens of Aran, since the
foundation of this city, were aiding and assisting ourselves
and our predecessors against the enemies of
your majesty and your predecessors in all times and
places, whereunto they were called as true and faithful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
and liege people to the crown of England, to maintain,
succour, and assist the town.</p>

<p>
"(Signed), "<span class="smcap">John Blake</span>, Mayor of Galway,<br />

<span class="smcap" style="margin-left:4em;">"Anthony Kirwan</span>, Bailiff."<br />
</p>

<p>Queen Elizabeth heard the appeal, but her Majesty
was inexorable. It is more than probable that the
O'Briens had caused, at least remotely, the alienation
of their inheritance by their own domestic feuds. At
the north extremity of Inishmore, the large island, not
far from Port Murvey, the islanders show a field where
human bones are frequently dug up, and for which
reason it is called <i>Farran-na-Cann</i>, "the field of the
sculls." Here the O'Briens are said at some remote
period to have slaughtered each other almost to
extermination. This sort of self-destruction is the
blackest blot on the page of Irish history. It has
always been, and alas! is Ireland's sad and unalienable
inheritance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">AN INDUSTRIOUS DISCOVERER.</div>

<p>Of the patentee, John Rawson, little is
remembered, save that in an instrument enrolled in
the Rolls Office, in 1594, he is called "an industrious
discoverer of lands for the Queen." The O'Flaherties
had now the gratification of seeing the O'Briens, also
an Irish sept, turned out of their inheritance, and the
same granted to a stranger.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LYNCHES.</div>

<p>After this period the
property and inheritance of the islands became and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
were vested in Sir Roebuck Lynch, of Galway. How
Sir Roebuck became proprietor of the islands we
have been unable, with certainty, to learn; but we
might hazard a plausible guess that Sir John Rawson
was granted whatever estate O'Brien had forfeited,
and that what O'Brien did forfeit as mortgagor was
the equity of redemption in the islands; that consequently
Lynch, the mortgagee, remained in possession
of the legal estate, and he, on Rawson failing
to perform the covenants in mortgage deed contained,
foreclosed the mortgage, and thus probably the
fee and the equity of redemption became united in
one and the same person, Sir Roebuck Lynch.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1618. "Indenture of June 20th, between Henry
Lynch, son and heir of Roebuck Lynch, of Galway,
deceased, of the one part, and William Anderson, of
Aran, in said county, of the other, whereby he, the
said Henry Lynch, for and in consideration of a sum
of &pound;50 of English currency to him paid, did thereby
demise and assign all that and those, a moiety of the
said three islands to him, the said William Anderson,
his executors, administrators, and assigns, for a long
term of years, excepting thereout" what must have
then been in the islands, "<i>great trees</i>, mines, and
minerals, and hawks, at an annual rent of &pound;3 Irish,
and a proportion of port corn, as therein is set forth."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1641. The clan Tiege O'Briens still claimed
the islands as their legitimate inheritance, and, taking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
advantage of the troubles of this troubled year, prepared
to attack them with a considerable force, and
with the aid of a gentleman of extensive property
and influence in the county of Clare, Boetius Clancy
the younger. This project, however, was frustrated
by the opposition of the Marquis of Clanricarde, then
governor of the county of Galway.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">ARCHBISHOP O'QUEELY.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1645. The death of Malachy O'Queely,
Catholic Archbishop of Tuam, occurred in this year.
To him John Colgan was indebted for a description
of the three islands of Aran and their churches.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1651. When the royal authority was fast
declining, the Marquis of Clanricarde resolved to
fortify these islands, wherein he placed 200 musketeers
with officers and a gunner, under the command of
Sir Robert Lynch, owner of the islands. The fort of
Ardkyn, in the large island, was soon after repaired
and furnished with cannon, and by this means held
out against the Parliamentary forces near a year after
the surrender of Galway. In December, 1650, the Irish,
routed in every other quarter, landed here 700 men.
On the 9th of the following January, 1300 foot, with
a battering piece, were shipped from the Bay of Galway
to attack them, and 600 men were marched to Iar
Connaught, to be thence sent, if necessary, to the assistance
of the assailants.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SURRENDER OF ARAN.</div>

<p>On the 15th the islands surrendered
on the following terms:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"Articles concluded between Major James Harrisson
and Captain William Draper, on behalf of the Commissary-General
Reynolds, Commander-in-Chief of the
Parliamentary forces in the isles of Aran, and Captain
John Blackwall and Captain Brien Kelly, commissioners
appointed by Colonel Oliver Synnot, commander
of the Fort of Ardkyn, for the surrender of
the said Fort.</p>

<p>"(1) It is concluded and agreed that all the officers
and soldiers both belonging to sea and land shall have
quarters, as also all others the clergyman and other
persons within the Fort. (2) That they shall have six
weeks for their transportation into Spain or any other
place in amity with the State of England, and that
hostages shall be given by Colonel Synnot for the
punctual performance of these Articles. (3) That
Colonel Synnot shall deliver up, with all necessaries
of war, by three o'clock this 15th of January, 1652,
before which time all officers and soldiers belonging
to the said Fort shall march with drums beating to the
Church near Ardkyn and there lay down their arms.
(4) That Colonel Synnot and the captains, eight in
number, shall have liberty to carry their swords, the
other officers and soldiers to lay down their arms;
that Commissary Reynolds shall nominate four officers
of the Fort hostages. (5) That Colonel Synnot, with
the rest of the officers and all other persons in the
Fort shall, upon delivering their arms and delivering<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
their hostages, be protected from the violence of the
soldiery, and with the first conveniency be sent to
the county Galway, there to remain for six weeks in
quarters, in which time they are to be transported
as aforesaid, provided that no person whatsoever
belonging to the Fort of Ardkyn found guilty of
murder be included in these articles, or have any
benefit thereby."</p>

<div class="sidenote">ERASMUS SMITH.</div>

<p>The Parliamentary forces, on taking possession of
the fortifications, found several large pieces of cannon,
with a considerable quantity of arms and ammunition;
they seized also a French shallop with twenty-eight
oars and several large boats. The Fort was soon
after repaired and strongly reinforced. The late proprietor
of the islands, Sir Robert Lynch, was declared
a forfeiting traitor, and his right made over to Erasmus
Smith, Esq., a London adventurer whose interest was
afterwards purchased by Richard Butler, created Earl
of Aran in 1662.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1653. The castle of Ardkyn was by order of
the Lord Protector pulled down, and a strong fort
erected in its place. Thenceforth Aran became the
place of transportation for the Catholic clergy, whilst
on the mainland the most violent acts of oppression
and injustice openly took place. The King's arms and
every other emblem of royalty were torn down, and
fifty priests were shipped for Aran<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> until they could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
be transported to the West Indies, they being allowed
sixpence a day each for their support.</p>

<div class="sidenote">QUIT RENT.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1670. On the 9th of September, Charles II.,
by patent under the Act of Settlement, granted to
Richard, Earl of Aran, the great island, containing 2376
acres statute measure, all situate in the half barony
of Aran, county of Galway, at the annual rent of
18<i>s.</i> 5&frac12;<i>d.</i> crown rent, payable to the King and his
successors. We may observe that the "crown rent"
payable to the Crown for lands is the same rent as
that which was formerly paid to the abbot or prior
of the abbeys and priories confiscated from them
under the statute of Henry VIII.&mdash;consequently
lands held under the religious houses pay crown
rent even to this day. Quit rent (<i>Quietus Redditus</i>)
in the province of Connaught, merely three halfpence
an acre, was for the first time imposed at
the Restoration, and amounts in the islands of Aran
to &pound;14 8<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1687. A grant was made in this year by James
II. of three-fourths of the tithes of Aran islands to the
Most Reverend John Vesey, D.D., Protestant Lord
Archbishop of Tuam, and his successors in the See.
One could readily account for his Majesty's bestowing
the tithes in question on the Catholic archbishop,
but why he bestowed them on the Protestant line
appears unaccountable; yet so it is stated in the
appendix to the report of the Royal Commission<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
(1868) on the revenues and condition of the Established
Church, page 191.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1691. On the surrender of Galway to the
arms of William and Mary, a garrison was sent to
Aran, and a barrack therein built in which soldiers
were for many years stationed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE FLORA OF ARAN.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1700. An excursion was made to the islands
in this year by one whose name is well known by
those who prefer to contemplate the silent life of
vegetation to the saddening spectacle of man at variance
with his fellow-man. Edward Lnwyd spent many
months inspecting the flora of the islands, and having
done so, made his report upon them, which is said to
be a marvel in its way.</p>

<p>The fee of the islands had become vested in
Edmund Fitzpatrick of Galway, Esquire; and he in
1717 demised the whole island of Inisheer to Andrew
French of Galway, merchant, for thirty-one years, at
the yearly rent of &pound;100, with liberty to cut and carry
away as much straw from Straw Island as should be
deemed necessary to thatch the houses on the island
of Inisheer.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ROYAL FRANCHISE.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1746. The case of <i>The Mayor of Galway</i> v.
<i>Digby</i>, conversant as it was with the royalties of the
islands of Aran, caused great excitement in the town
during the summer assizes of the year. The action was
tried before Mr. Justice Caufield. Mr. Staunton, Mr.
French, and another, appeared as counsel for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
plaintiff; Mr. John Bodkin and Mr. Morgan for the
defendant. The case as stated by the learned counsel
for the plaintiff was that from times of remote antiquity
the O'Briens were lords of the isles of Aran, or to use
somewhat of legal phraseology, were lords of the
manor of Aran, and as such, and in their manorial
rights they were entitled to all the royal franchises,
wrecks, and other strays washed on the shores either
of the islands or mainlands of the bay. But the Crown
had made a grant of the royal franchises away from
the lords of the manor, and had conferred the same
on the Admiral of the Bay of Galway, the office of
Admiral of the Bay belonging to and being held by
the mayor of the town. Now, on the 1st of August,
1745, a great whale, which appeared in the Aran waters,
was stranded, and harpooned by the defendant, who
obtained from it no less than fifty gallons of oil. The
blubber and the whalebone were all there ready to be
transported to the Dublin market, and the defendant
had actually converted to his own use so much of
this royal franchise as would realize a sum of &pound;160.
Plaintiff's patent was full, ample, and large; so full, so
ample, and so large, that he, counsel, could not but
wonder that any lawyer at the bar would sign the
pleadings in a case in which a verdict must be
directed on the spot for the plaintiff.</p>

<p>Counsel for the defendant did not feel so sure of
the success of his learned friend's case as his learned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
friend did&mdash;quite the reverse; he must and at once ask
the learned judge for a direction that the verdict be
entered for him. He, Mr. Bodkin, admitted that a
sturgeon and a whale were royal fish, but they were
governed by widely different principles of law. If a
sturgeon had been washed on the shore, then the
King or his grantee could claim it and grant it to
whomsoever they pleased, and the grantee here would
not be entitled to it at all; but the whale is not the
King's property to grant. Half of the whale is the
perquisite of the Queen consort, and that being so,
the grant fails. The King is only entitled to the head
and the Queen to the tail. It was in old law laid
down to be for the Queen's convenience to have
abundance of whalebone for her boudoir, and so it
is said in Bracton [l. 3. ch. 3], "of the sturgeon let
it be noted that the King shall have it entire, but it
is otherwise of the whale, for the King shall have the
head and the queen the tail, <i>sturgeone observetur quod
rex illum habebit integrum: de Balena vero sufficit si
rex habeat caput et regina caudam</i>." A verdict was
directed against the plaintiff, but whether any after
move was made in the matter, or whether the Attorney-General
intervened, we have been unable to discover.
Suffice it to say that the corporation of Galway
interfered no more in the matter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1754. John Digby demised the island of
Inisheer to William MacNamara of Doolin, county<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
Clare, for thirty-one years, at an annual rent of
&pound;90.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ARCHBISHOP PHILLIPS.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1786. The Catholic Archbishop of Tuam, the
most Rev. Philip Phillips, D.D., partaking of the hospitality
of the parish priest of Aran, stopped a week in
the islands: sleeping, however, on a bed of rushes,
to which he had been unused, he got an attack of
bronchitis, of which he shortly after died at Cloonmore,
in the county of Mayo. One would have thought that
he could have outlived a discomfort of that trivial
kind, for he had been in early life a soldier&mdash;not a
feather-bed soldier, but a distinguished officer in the
Austrian service, and therefore it was that he was
called Captain Phillips to the last hour of his life.
It is not unworthy of remark that this prelate had,
previous to his translation to Tuam, been Bishop of
Killala, to which see he had in 1760 [1 Geo. III.]
been by James III., King <i>de jure sed non de facto</i> of
Great Britain and Ireland, nominated as appears by
the apostolic letter of Clement XIII., dated Rome,
November 24, 1760.</p>

<div class="sidenote">EARL BUTLER OF ARAN.</div>

<p>In the peerage we find that the earldom of Aran
has been twice bestowed on families bearing different
names. First in 1662, when Richard Butler (son of
James, the twelfth Earl and first Duke of Ormonde)
was created Earl of Aran. The honours of this
nobleman having expired on his death without issue,
the earldom was revived in 1693 in favour of Lord<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
Charles Butler, brother of James, the second Duke
of Ormonde. The story of the second Duke of
Ormonde is a sad one. Having filled the highest
offices in the state in Ireland under Charles II.,
he forgot his allegiance to his brother James II.,
and went over to the ranks of William and Mary.
In 1702 he was constituted by Queen Anne Commander-in-Chief
of the Forces of Great Britain, sent
against France and Spain, when he destroyed the
French fleet and sunk the Spanish galleons in the
harbour of Vigo, for which important services he
received the thanks of both houses of Parliament. In
1715 (2 George I.), his grace was attainted by
the British but not by the Irish House of Parliament
of high treason, and &pound;10,000 set upon his head should
he land in Ireland. His grace then retired to Avignon,
and died in 1745, a pensioner of the crown of Spain.
Upon the duke's death the Earl of Aran became
entitled <i>de jure</i> to the dukedom, but was not aware
of his rights, which he never claimed, being of opinion
that the British Parliament destroyed not only the
English but the Irish titles of honour of his deceased
brother, the second duke. The Earl of Aran died
without issue male, December 17, 1758, when the title
became and was extinct.</p>

<div class="sidenote">GORE, EARL OF ARAN.</div>

<p>After four years, in 1762, the
earldom was bestowed on another noble house, that of
Gore, in the person of Sir Arthur Gore, and from him
is descended Sir Arthur Charles William Fox Gore,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
fifth Earl of Aran, born on the night of storm, January
6, 1839.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1857. The islands were visited by the
British Association, under the leadership of Sir William
Wilde, M.D., and the results of the visit were subsequently
embodied in an interesting pamphlet by
Martin Haverty, Esq., long assistant librarian to the
Honourable Society of the King's Inns, Dublin.
Subsequently the Earl of Dunraven, accompanied
by a number of scientific friends, proceeded to the
islands, when a series of magnificent photographs
were executed, printed, and published under the
supervision and direction of the accomplished editor,
Miss Stokes, who has edited that ponderous work
which throws so much light on the early history of
this country.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE ARAN ISLANDERS.</div>

<p>We have thus far spoken of the scenery of the islands,
and of their natural history, of their antiquities, Pagan
and Christian, and of their annals; let us now turn to
speak of their people and of what others think of them.
Doctor Petrie thus, in 1841, writes:</p>

<p>"I had heard so much of the Aran islanders, of
their primitive simplicity, and singular hospitality,
that I could not help doubting the truth of a picture
so pleasing and romantic, and felt anxious to ascertain
by personal observation how far it might be real.
Collectively, the inhabitants may be said to exhibit
the virtues of the Irish character with as little intermixture
of vices as the lot of humanity will permit.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A POLITE PEOPLE.</div>

<p>"They are a brave and hardy race, industrious and
enterprising, as is sufficiently evidenced, not only by
the daily increasing number of their fishing vessels,
the barren rocks which they are covering with soil<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
and making productive, but still more by the frequency
of their emigration from their beloved homes and
friends to a distant country, led solely by the
hope that their indefatigable labour may be employed
there to the greater ultimate benefit of their
families.</p>

<p>"They are simple and innocent, but also thoughtful
and intelligent, credulous, and, in matters of faith,
what persons of a different creed would call superstitious.
Lying and drinking, the vices which Arthur
Young considers as appertaining to the Irish character,
form at least no part of it in Aran, for happily their
common poverty holds out less temptation to the
vices of lying and drinking.</p>

<p>"I do not mean to say they are rigidly temperate,
or that instances of excess, followed by the usual Irish
consequences of broken heads, do not occasionally
occur&mdash;such could not be expected, when their convivial
temperament and dangerous and laborious
occupations are remembered. They never swear,
and they have a high sense of decency and propriety,
honour and justice. In appearance they are healthy,
comely, and prepossessing; in their dress (with few
exceptions) clean and comfortable; in manner serious
yet cheerful, and easily excited to gaiety; frank and
familiar in conversation, and to strangers polite and
respectful, but at the same time free from servile
adulation. They are communicative, but not too<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
loquacious; inquisitive after information, but delicate
in seeking it, and grateful for its communication.</p>

<p>"If the inhabitants of the Aran islands could be
considered as a fair specimen of the ancient, and
present wild Irish, the veriest savages in the globe,
as the learned Pinkerton calls them&mdash;those whom
chance has led to their hospitable shores to admire
their simple virtues would be likely to regret that
the blessings of civilization had ever been extended
to any portion of this very wretched country."<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">RESIGNATION OF THE ARANITES.</div>

<p>The devotional expressions of the Aranites and the
meekness and resignation with which they bear misfortunes
or afflictions is the most striking feature in
their character. "I had a beautiful girl for a daughter,"
said an Aranite peasant, "and I laid her in her grave
yesterday, praise be to His holy Name that took her
to Himself." A poor woman asking for charity tells
you that "she hasn't eaten a bit this day, thanks be
to God." Another says, "In troth I have been suffering
for a long time from poverty and sickness, glory
be to God." Their mode of salutation, too, is worthy
of remembrance. The visitor on entering a house
says, "God save all here." Meet a man on the road,
greet him with a "God save you, sir;" instantly he'll
remove his hat and reply, "God save you kindly, your
honour." If you pass by men working in a field, always
address them with a "God bless the work, boys;" they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
will answer, "And you too, sir," and if you speak in
Irish so much the better, and how their eyes will
brighten up at hearing their mother-tongue spoken by
"a gentleman's honour!"</p>

<div class="sidenote">THEIR PURITY OF MORALS.</div>

<p>To the purity of the morals of the Aran women
there are many testimonies. Births of illegitimate
children are of rare occurrence indeed. Sir Francis
Head, in 1852, made a tour through Ireland, looking
into every police barrack as he passed, and when all
that was done he published a work entitled "A Fortnight
in Ireland." Unsparing in his vilifications of the
Catholic clergy, he is compelled to compare the
people to whom they minister favourably with those
of other countries in the world. Arriving in Galway
his first visit was to the police barrack, where he
inquired of the officer as to the morals of the
Claddagh people, when the south isles of Aran thus
came to be mentioned.</p>

<p>Sir F. Head. "How long have you been on duty
in Galway?"</p>

<p>The officer replies, "Only six months."</p>

<p><i>Question.</i> "During that time have you known of
many instances of illegitimate children being born
in the Claddagh?"</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i> "Not a single case&mdash;not one; and not
only have I never known of such a case, but I never
heard any person attribute immorality to the fishwomen.
I was on duty in the three islands of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
Aran, inhabited almost exclusively by fishermen, who
also farm potatoes, and I never heard of any one of
their women (who are remarkable for their beauty)
having had an illegitimate child, nor did I ever hear
it attributed to them. Indeed I have been informed
by a magistrate who lived in Galway for eight years,
and has been on temporary duty in the isles of Aran,
that he has never heard there of a case of that nature.
These people, however, when required to pay poor-rates,
having no native poor of their own in the
workhouse, resisted the payment of what they considered
a very unjust tax. In fact they closed their
doors when the rate was only partially collected."</p>

<p>Three and twenty years after Sir Francis Head wrote
the above we read in the writings of Frank Thorpe
Porter, Esq., a member of the Irish Bar, long a divisional
magistrate for the city of Dublin, and some time
acting chief justice for Gibraltar, a further testimony
of the worth of the islanders. On his return from
Spain, he visited his son, Mr. Frank Porter, M.D.,
medical officer of the islands,<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> and whilst he was there
several cases of typhus fever of a malignant type
occurred.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THEIR KINDNESS.</div>

<p>The cottages are, with three or four exceptions,
thatched and without any upper storey. The invariable
course adopted during the prevalence of the
epidemic was to nail up the door of the patient's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
apartment, to take out the sashes of the window, and
render it the sole means of external communication.
The medical attendant, priests, and nurse tenders had
no other means of ingress and egress, and no objection
appears to have ever been made to the system.
Doctor Porter was stricken down by the disease, and
although ten days had elapsed before a medical
gentleman arrived from Galway, the doctor surmounted
the fearful malady. "I spent," writes Mr.
Porter, "each night in my son's apartment, and
during the day he was attended by a nurse. Almost
every night I heard some gentle taps outside the
vacant window, and on going over to it, I would be
told 'My wife is afther making a pitcher of whey for
the poor docthor, you'll find it on the windy-stool;' or
'I brought you two jugs of milk to make whey for
your son.' When the crisis had passed, and nutriment
and stimulants were required, I would be told, 'We
biled down two chickens into broth for the docthor,
I hope it will sarve him.' Rabbits, chickens, and
joints of kid were tendered for his use, and a bottle of
'rale Connemara Puttyeen,' was deposited on the
window-stool. The people were all kind and anxious,
and when he became able to walk out he was constantly
saluted and congratulated; but no person would
approach him if they could avoid it. They were all
dreadfully apprehensive that he might impart the
dreadful contagion. I brought him home as soon as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
possible, but he and I will always remember most
gratefully the unvarying kindness and sympathy we
experienced in Aran where they refused to take a
farthing either for gratuity or compensation."</p>

<div class="sidenote">THEIR HOSPITALITY.</div>

<p>On September 3, 1886, Mr. R.F. Mullery, clerk
of the Galway Union, thus, in answer to my letter
to him, writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The present poundage-rate, one shilling in the
pound, is exceptionally low, owing to a grant of &pound;440,
under the 'relief of the distressed Unions Act,' having
been made to the islands. The average rate for the
last ten years was three shillings in the pound. We
never have islanders. There is no hospital, though
there ought to be one, on the islands, as the sick poor
are deterred from coming thirty miles by boat to the
workhouse. The general health is exceptionally good,
and very many live to a very old age. I have an
opportunity of knowing this, as I have to examine the
registry of deaths at the end of each quarter. The
islanders as a rule are very intelligent, and quick at
picking up anything they can either hear or see;
and, best of all, they are a moral people, a case of
illegitimacy scarcely ever occurring in the islands, and
then it is looked on as a crime of the blackest dye.</p>

learned friend, Philip Lyster, Esq., barrister-at-law,
resident magistrate of the district in which Aran is
situated, bears testimony to the peaceful and law-abiding
character of the islanders:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><span style="margin-left: 22em;">"Belfast, September 26, 1886.</span></p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Burke</span>,
</p>

<p>"My absence from Galway upon special
duty in the north has prevented my replying to your
note of the 18th inst. until now.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THEIR INDUSTRY.</div>

<p>"The Aran islanders as a body are an extremely
well-behaved and industrious people. There are
sometimes assaults on each other, which invariably
arise out of some dispute in connection with the land,
and are generally between members of the same family.
There are very few cases of drunkenness. I have
known two months to elapse without a single case
being brought up. I should say that for four years,
speaking from memory, I have not sent more than
six or seven persons to jail without the option of a
fine. There is no jail on the islands. We hardly
ever have a case of petty larceny. I remember only
one case of potato stealing, when the defendant was
sent for trial and punished. There are often cases of
alleged stealing of seaweed in some <i>bona-fide</i> dispute as
to the ownership, which we then leave to arbitration
by mutual consent. I know very little of the history
of the islands. In the last century justice used to be
administered by one of the O'Flaherty family, the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>father of the late James O'Flaherty, of Kilmurvy House,
Esq., J.P. He was the only magistrate in the islands,
but ruled as a king. He issued his summons for
'the first fine day,' and presided at a table in the open
air. If any case deserved punishment he would say
to the defendant, speaking in Irish, 'I must transport
you to Galway jail for a month.' The defendant
would beg hard not to be transported to Galway,
promising good behaviour in future. If, however, his
worship thought the case serious, he would draw his
committal warrant, hand it to the defendant, who
would, without the intervention of police or any one
else, take the warrant, travel at his own expense to
Galway, and deliver himself up, warrant in hand, at
the county jail. I am afraid things are very much
changed since those days. Excuse my not going more
fully into the subject-matter of your letter. Duties
here are heavy. Believe me,</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 22em;">"Sincerely yours,</span><br />
<span class="smcap" style="margin-left: 24em;">"Philip Lyster.</span>"<br />
</p></div>

<div class="sidenote">THEIR DRESS.</div>

<p>The dress of the islanders is said, by those who
understand such things, to be picturesque; but beyond
all doubt their shoes, or rather slippers, made of
untanned cow-hide with the hairy side out, and
without heels and without soles, are the most
unpicturesque foot-dress in Europe. These they call
Pampoodies.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THEIR PAMPOODIES.</div>

<p>The raw cow-hide, which is cut to fit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
the foot, is stitched down the instep to the toe and
also on the back of the heel. Soft as a glove, the
wearer soon acquires an elasticity of step and an erect
and noble bearing in his walk, to which the wearer
of the more picturesque boot can never attain.
There are two things, it is said, not to be found in
Aran&mdash;corns on the foot and frogs in the fens.
The young women on Sundays have their hair
trimmed and bound up very tastily; but what ornament
can these young people put on equal to the
virtuous characters they bear? On Sundays and
holy days the churches are well filled, and the altars
well served by priests as zealous as the Catholic
Church can in Ireland lay claim to&mdash;the Rev. Father
O'Donohoe, P.P., and the Rev. Father Waters, C.C.</p>

<p>The extreme politeness of the islanders, and their
desire to impart any knowledge they possess of
antiquarian lore or of the legends or fairy tales with
which the islands abound, must strike with force the
mind of the observing tourist. Their reverence for
the dead, and their affection for their loved and
departed friends, impel them to erect, sometimes in
long lines on the roadside, square stone pillars about
ten feet in height by three feet each side, all of the
same measurements, surmounted each with a well-cut
stone cross and with inscriptions such as the following:
"<i>Sta viator.</i> Stay, traveller. O Lord have
mercy on the soul of Mac Dara Ternan, who departed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
this life 26th June, 1842." These monuments of the
dead, who are generally interred in far-distant churchyards,
have by moonlight a ghastly appearance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THEIR HOLY WELLS.</div>

<p>The
reverence of the Aranite for holy wells is great, nor
will he suffer in silence his faith in them to be ridiculed.
"Can you," said a stranger, "be so silly as to believe
that that well gushing out of the hillside was placed
there by a saint, in dim and remote ages?" The
peasant replied that a well on a mountain side or on
a mountain top appeared to him to be miraculous.
"And isn't it, sir, wonderful to see water on the top
of a hill? And it must flow up the hill inside before it
can flow down the hill outside;" and water flowing up
the hill inside or outside was to his mind miraculous.
The stranger answered that, "the water may have
been forced up from some far-off lake on a higher
level." The peasant's answer was, "that may be so
and it may not be so, but your honour does not give
us any proof that it is so." Wells in all ages and in
all places are associated with the marvellous, even
from the well of Zem-zem to that on the Aran rocks,
and we are not so sure that the geological stranger was
quite satisfactory as to his theory of wells on a
mountain summit.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE ISLE OF O'BRAZIL.</div>

<p>Speaking of the wonders by which the native of
Aran is surrounded, what wonder can be greater than
that of the mirage, an island that is said to rise after
sunset from the Atlantic? A phantom island which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
the people call "O'Brazil, the Isle of the Blest," upon
which a city like the New Jerusalem is built, and the
old men say that that city hath no need of the sun
nor of the moon to shine in it, neither does it need
the light of the lamp any more at all. That island
with that city has, they say, over and over again
appeared far away on the Atlantic. Alison, we
remember, somewhere in his charming account of the
French in Egypt, gives a note on the mirage of the
desert, where the parched-up soldiers of the French
republic, in 1798, used to see far-distant lakes into
which tumbled the waters of mighty waterfalls. On,
on the French soldiers rushed. Alas! the phantom
vanished; and so vanishes the phantom city seen on a
summer evening from the lofty cliffs of the Aran
islands. To follow in search of this "Isle of the Blest"
an Aranite peasant once resolved. He had heard of
St. Brendan and of Christopher Columbus, and of those
mariners who, sailing over the seas in search of fame
and of gold, were fortunate enough to find both. The
peasant, in spite of all persuasion, set sail.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A PHANTOM-ISLAND.</div>
<p>
The phantom receded; he followed. Still following, he
never returned to Aran again, and his mournful fate
is thus sung by Gerald Griffin:&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote">OLD AGE IN ARAN.</div>

<p>The extreme old age to which the inhabitants live
in Aran proves the excellence of the air and of the
food. Neither asthma, nor gout, nor rheumatism are
known in portions of the islands. Formerly there
were forests of oak and of pine in Inishmore, which
must have been peculiarly suited to those who suffered
from diseases of the chest.</p>

<p>The fishery here begins in the spring, and great
quantities of spillard, cod, ling, haddock, turbot,
gurnet, and mackerel are caught. The natives look
much to the herring fishery, which seldom disappoints
their expectations. In May the pursuit of the sun-fish
gives employment to many, and it appears, from
evidence given before the Irish House of Commons
in 1762, that sun-fish of average size were worth from
&pound;5 to &pound;6 each. Then all manner of shellfish are
in abundance in those waters&mdash;multivalves, bivalves,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
and univalves&mdash;lobsters, oysters, periwinkles. The
Aranite may be said to be an amphibious animal&mdash;a
fisherman and a farmer, but as a fisherman he
is powerless to cope with them whose ships are built
for the deep sea fishery.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LAND COMMISSION IN ARAN.</div>

<p>It was as a farmer we had
the pleasure of seeing him, and in the court of the Land
Commission, which sat in Kilronan on the 20th of
July, 1886. The Land Court presented an animated
appearance on that day, the islanders crowding in to
hear their cases. Unlike any Europeans that we know
of, the men sat or squatted on the floor in manner as
the Mahometans would in the mosques of Bussorah.
Remarkably intelligent, they gave their evidence in
court with an ease and precision, especially when
examined in Irish, which it was refreshing to hear.
Many of the cases stood over from the Land Commission
sittings in the islands on June 25, 1885,
on which occasion there were ninety-five listed for a
hearing, and of these the following, the first heard, is
a fair specimen of all the rest, the Commission
being composed of Mr. Crean, B.L., Professor Baldwin,
and Mr. Barry.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Irish Land Commission.</span></p>

<p>Michael O'Donel, tenant.</p>

<p>Miss Digby, Landenstown, county Kildare, and the
Hon. Thomas Kenelm Digby St. Lawrence (second
son of Thomas, twenty-ninth baron, third Earl of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
Howth&mdash;by his second wife, Henrietta Digby, only
child of Peter Barfoot, Esq., of Landenstown, county
Kildare), landlords.</p>

<p>Mr. Concannon appeared as solicitor for the
tenants; Mr. Stephens, solicitor, for the landlords.</p>

<p>Michael O'Donel sworn.</p>

<p>Mr. Concannon. O'Donel, are you tenant of this
holding?</p>

<p>I am, your honour.</p>

<p>How long are you tenant?</p>

<p>Since I was born&mdash;and that's fifty years ago.</p>

<p>Do you swear that, that you were tenant since you
were born? How long are you paying rent?</p>

<p>Since my father's death, about eight years ago last
Pathrickmuss,&mdash;that's the time I'm the rale tenant.
My father and his father were tenants on that holding
since the Deluge at all events&mdash;couldn't swear longer
than that.</p>

<p>Do you swear that?</p>

<p>Well, of coorse I couldn't swear it out and out.</p>

<p>What quantity of land have you in your holding?</p>

<p>Well, twenty-two acres exactly, be the same more or
less. [Mr. Stephens, for the landlords, said that twenty-two
acres was the true area of his farm.] Five of the
twenty-two acres were nothing but rocks and stones,
without one blade of grass in them, so that it was
seventeen acres of productive land he had, at an
annual rental of &pound;3 18<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, and it was not worth that.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p>To the court. The last change of rent was thirty
years ago.</p>

<p>What buildings have you?</p>

<p>The house is my own, and the barn. Both are
thatched. [Mr. Stephens did not claim the houses.]
Improvements?&mdash;Well, there are walls, but did not
measure them, and small gardens.</p>

<p>In answer to Mr. Concannon: We claim to be
entitled to take the seaweed for manure. We have
no turf, nor timber to burn, and have to pay &pound;3 a year
for two boat loads of turf. The stock on his farm
was a cow and a veal calf, a horse, five sheep, and
eight lambs. Shears them every year, but the wool he
never sells as he keeps it for his family. As for tillage,
he had about eighty stone of potatoes last year,
and by his stock he realized &pound;12; that includes
&pound;6 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> that he received for a couple of veal calves.
He had no grain crops. He had a couple of pigs too.
As for his stock, maybe it's little he'd have out of them
coming home to his wife and childher, and his was
a nice wife, thanks be to God. His sheep he brings
by boat to the county of Clare, sells them at the fair
of Ennistymon. Has to pay freight 3<i>d.</i> a head for
sheep and lambs. His cattle and pigs he puts on the
mail boat and sails them to Galway&mdash;the freight being
2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> for calves, and a shilling a head for pigs. And
wasn't he sixteen days weatherbound in Galway last
February, after the fair-day?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Concannon would produce no valuer, he felt
perfect confidence in the commissioners.</p>

<p>This closed the tenant's case.</p>

<p>Mr. Thompson, of Clonskea Castle, county Dublin,
sworn. Is the agent on the estate; succeeded his father,
who had been agent for many years. Witness has in
his custody all the rentals and leases of the estate from
1794. "The rental in 1800 was &pound;2143, as fixed by
valuation in that year. In 1812 the rental was &pound;2668;
in 1827, &pound;2145 10<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>; in 1846, &pound;1937 17<i>s.</i> 7<i>d.</i>;
in 1881, &pound;2067; in 1885, &pound;2067; the acreage of the
islands being 11,288 acres. The lands are in the
hands of tenants, with the exception of two croggeries
which are in my occupation."</p>

<p>The learned chairman, Mr. Crean, B.L., inquired
what a croggery meant.</p>

<p>Witness said that "croggery" was a very ancient
name for fourths. The entire islands were divided into
townlands, which townlands contained 4 or 6 quarters
each, every quarter containing 16 croggeries, and every
croggery containing 16 acres. Inishmore thus contained
4 townlands and 4t. &times; 6qrs. &times; 16crog. &times; 16ac. = 6144 acres.
On Inishmaan there are two townlands, which contain
6 quarters each. On Inisheer there is only one
townland containing 4 quarters. The tenants have
manure and seaweed from the sea shore free of
charge. The seaweed was very valuable in 1866,
when the kelp made on the islands realized &pound;2577,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
being &pound;5 a ton. There is no kelp made now, owing
to the fall in prices. For twenty years the value
of a tenant's interest in a croggery varied from &pound;30
to &pound;90.</p>

<p>This closed the landlord's evidence, and the lay
sub-commissioners in due time inspected the farms.
The case came on for judgment, and the court
reduced the rent from &pound;3 18<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to &pound;2 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>,
being 39.75 per cent. reduction.</p>

<p>All the other cases were similar to the last.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, July 20, 1886, her Majesty's gunboat
was moored at the New Docks, Galway, for the
purpose of taking the Land Commission composed
of Mr. Crean, Lieut.-Colonel Bayley, Mr. Rice and
myself, to Aran. The voyage was one to be remembered.
The wind, from the S.S.W., rose to a tempest,
not a sail in sight. Nevertheless the vessel held on
her course, though the wind was high against her,
and she let drop her anchor in due time in the Bay
of Kilronan. No mail boat from "Europe" arrived
in the islands during the greater part of that week.
To fix a fair rent was the object of fifty-four originating
notices which now came on for hearing. Of
this number two were dismissed on points of law,
and forty-nine had their rents fixed, the sum of the
old rents being &pound;384, which was now reduced to
the new or judicial rent of &pound;231, being a reduction
in favour of the tenants of &pound;153, say forty per cent.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
This reduction, as a matter of course, was well
received by the islanders; but the questions that are
irresistibly forced on the mind are, can any reduction
of rent improve their condition? And can any tenure
of their farms, or any estate therein, however large,
raise them from their condition of comparative poverty
to that of wealth? And would it be of material benefit
to them to sweep from the landlord the last farthing
of his rent, and to grant the same to them? And
would it not be for their weal rather that they had
schools to instruct the young in the natural history of
the fish, and in the ways of science connected with
the deep sea fisheries, and in navigation and all its
kindred branches, such as mathematics, spherical
trigonometry, the use of the compass, magnetic
needle, the constellations, and nautical tables, etc.,
together with all the trades incident to fishing such
as carpentering, ship building, nail making, sail, net,
rope, and line making?</p>

<div class="sidenote">BARONESS BURDETT-COUTTS.</div>

<p>And ought not the young and the old to be
familiarized with the name of the Baroness Burdett-Coutts,
and with her wonderful works in the cause of
the Baltimore Fishery? And would it not be for the
weal of the islanders, and of the nation, the Irish
nation, that the islanders should be supplied, not for
charity, with deep sea fishing appliances, as the
Baltimore fishermen have been?</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE ARAN FISHERIES.</div>

<p>The ignorance of our fishing population is thus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
deplored in the report of "the inspectors of the sea
and inland fisheries of Ireland," 1887:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is melancholy to find how deficient our coast
population is in all these matters, and that the rising
generation are left untaught in arts, from the exercise
of which, wealth would be brought into our land, and
industry, self-reliance, and temperance inculcated,
while the seas around our island teem with fish; so
much so that often, when a great capture occurs,
quantities of fish are lost from the want of scientific
knowledge as to the best means of curing; and, at
the same time, Ireland is <i>importing</i> about 10,000 tons
of cured fish <i>annually</i>, when she might be <i>exporting</i>
double, or even treble that quantity.</p>

<p>"Thousands of pounds are also sent annually from
Ireland to England, Scotland, and the Isle of Man,

which might be kept at home, and our people

"<span class="smcap">My dear Burke,</span></p>

<p>"I have your note here. There is a large
number of open row boats and curraghs on the three
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>islands of Aran, but that is their only mode of fishing;
and they can only fish at short distances from the
land, and cannot fish except in suitable weather.
There is not a single first-class fishing vessel attached
to the islands. The people are too poor to provide
themselves with such, or obtain security for loans for
such. There is one drawback to such vessels being
kept, the want of proper harbour accommodation.
There is a pier at the north island, but vessels cannot
approach it unless near high water, and there is no
means of improving it by extension. To make a
good harbour it would be necessary to build a new
pier into deep water; then, if any quantity of fish is
taken, the vessels must lose their time and bring
them to Galway, thirty miles. If there were telegraphic
communication between the island and
mainland, the Galway steamer might be sent out
when there was a large quantity of fish, or if there
were a number of first-class vessels there, it might
pay a steamer to attend them regularly as they do in
the North Sea.</p>

<p>"The Manx, Cornish, and French vessels, only go
there in the early part of the year when the mackerel
sets in. The Frenchmen slightly salt the fish on
board, and take them to France and come back
again for another cargo.</p>

conjunction with Colonel Fraser and Mr. Mahony, in
expending a grant of &pound;20,000 in the scheduled

<p>The absence of first-class fishing boats accounts
for the absence of wealth in the islands. The Aran
fisherman sees the French fisherman fishing whilst he
becomes a farmer and a labourer at wages not worth
working for. The Rev. William Killride, rector
of Aran, thus writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
<span style="margin-left:32em;">"Aran, Dec. 11, 1886.</span><br />
<br />
"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,<br />
</p>

<p>"Men's wages vary. There is no constant
work whatever. Spring and the seaweed gathering for
kelp are the chief harvests for the labourer. A labourer
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>has seldom more than four months' labour in the year;
so that it is a necessity on his part to get gardens on
hire. Until last year or the year before he got from
1<i>s.</i> to 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> in spring, with his diet; at harvest, about
1<i>s.</i> with his diet, three meals in the day, bread and
tea for breakfast, etc. When there is a hurry in seaweeding
time he used to get 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> and diet, but this
lasts only a week twice in the year."</p>

<div class="sidenote">TREES IN ARAN.</div>

<p>The writer
then speaks of several other matters connected with
the island and about the possibility of growing timber
there. "My little grove was planted by myself. I find
the greatest difficulty in preserving it, seven trees
being destroyed this year. Then I planted every
nook and cranny with evergreens; but they were
plucked up three several times. I got sick of this
thing. Many places in the island were covered
with trees. In fact, fifty years ago or so, I have
been informed that a large portion of the island
grew trees, especially hazel, from 20 to 26 feet in
height.</p>

<p>"What kept the poor rate down both last year and
this was the amount of relief given out. Mr. Thompson,
the agent, laid out &pound;140 on a road, and &pound;136
on seed potatoes. Sir John Barrington has given me
upwards of &pound;100 for this object, and this year he
gave me &pound;80 or &pound;90 for seed potatoes and &pound;120
for relief and also money to assist emigration and to
buy turf. The people will suffer terribly this year for

<div class="sidenote">BARONESS BURDETT-COUTTS.</div>

<p>The poverty of the Aran fishermen was equalled
until lately by that of the Baltimore fishermen in the
south of Ireland. Their altered state of circumstances
appears by a report of the inspectors of Irish fisheries
on the sea fisheries of Ireland, presented to his
Excellency the Lord Lieutenant in the autumn of
1886. The Baltimore fishing boats had been mere
curraghs worth about &pound;6 each. Owing to the
liberality of Baroness Burdett-Coutts, of imperishable
fame, a number of deep sea fishing boats were built
at a cost of &pound;600 each, which was lent to the Baltimore
men on easy rates of repayment. The report
states that at Baltimore, in the year 1885, there were
41,610 boxes of fish caught by fishermen previously
unemployed, and these boxes of fish realized a sum of
&pound;34,585. Mostly every tradesman in the town was
employed; the carpenters in making boxes, the
smiths in strapping them round with hoop iron.
"Three vessels arrived in Baltimore loaded with ice,
and eight hulks were used for storing it, two at a
cost of &pound;20 a month, the others were owned by a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
company of fish buyers, at a cost of &pound;1 5<i>s.</i> a week
each. This for ten would amount to &pound;3080, besides
a large expenditure on packers." Fancy the like
sums scattered in Aran!</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE ARAN FISHERIES.</div>

<p>At Baltimore in 1886, sixteen steamers were employed
in carrying the fish to England, at an estimated
cost of &pound;400 each per month.</p>

<p>Over 100 men were employed in the boats used by
the buyers; and at a rate of wages which, for twelve
weeks, would amount to about &pound;1500, besides a large
expenditure upon packers, etc.</p>

<p>In 1886 three vessels arrived with ice, containing
1423 tons, all of which were imported, and eight hulks
were used for storing it, owned by a company of fish
buyers.</p>

give to the Commissioners of Public Works a joint

<div class="sidenote">IRISH FISHERIES&mdash;IRISH PARLIAMENT.</div>

<p>Of the immensity of the fisheries we can form no
estimate. But to the islanders the fisheries are
worthless without boats, and without the means of
obtaining boats; without funds, and without the means
of obtaining funds. Except "under very exceptional
circumstances, and to a very limited extent," they are
unable to launch out into the deep and let down their
nets for a draught. It is said by one party that a
different state of things would prevail had the Irish
people an Irish Parliament. That may be so and it
may not be so; but one thing is certain, that whilst
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>in 1887 no bonus of any kind can be obtained, in
1787 bonuses of many kinds could be obtained, and
were obtained. In the 27th year of George III.,
<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1787, an Irish Act was passed "for the encouragement
of the fishery usually called the deep
sea fishery." The marginal note of that section, a
section too long to repeat, states that "bounties will
be given, 80 guineas for the greatest quantity of
herrings caught by the crew of any one vessel, and
imported between the 1st of June and the 31st of
December in any one year; 60 guineas for the
next greatest quantity, 40 guineas for the next, and
20 guineas for the next, to be paid on the 1st of
January following." By the same Act bounties of
four shillings a barrel were authorized to be given for
herrings; and by another section, the fourteenth, three
shillings and threepence by the hundredweight was
allowed for all dried cod, ling, and other fish mentioned
therein. Bounties, however, have long since been
discouraged by political economists, and loans have
long since been discouraged by other economists, and
between those scientists money for the improvement
of the Aran fishery was never so hard to be got at as
at this present time.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE ARAN FISHERIES&mdash;TRAWLING.</div>

<p>From the coastguard return it would appear that
the Galway coastguard division is guarded by five
coastguard stations, two of them being on the Aran
islands, in which there has been an increase in 1886<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
of two second class and sixteen third class boats solely
engaged in fishing. The trawlers work from Barna
to the islands of Aran. That trawling injures the
supply of fish is insisted upon by the one party and
denied by the other. A court of public inquiry was
held in Galway, where the entire question was
investigated; the result of which investigation will
form the subject of a special report. We shall only
observe that the Scotch Fishery Board has prohibited
trawling in some places in Scotland. "In the Galway
Bay trawling was prohibited for a number of years in
about half the bay. For about four years it was not
followed at all, and, so far as the evidence at public
inquiries could be relied on, there was no improvement
in the fisheries during the cessation of this
mode of fishing in either the whole, or part of the
bay. In the case of Dublin Bay trawling has been
prohibited for nearly forty-four years; and the question
arises whether the fisheries of that bay have increased
in that period.</p>

<p>"In other bays no trawling has ever been carried on;
and the present state of the fisheries in such places
will have to be carefully inquired into."<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>Having thus far spoken of the wealth that might
be realized by the islanders from the waters that
surround their islands, let us turn to speak of the wealth
that might be realized by the islanders from the
islands themselves&mdash;wealth produceable neither by
patches of potatoes, nor by tillage, nor by minerals,
nor by pasturage. On the islands are vast terraces
of naked rocks, and there are vast terraces of
rocks not naked on which grew those forests of oak,
of yew, and of fir of which we have already spoken,
when treating of Druidism.</p>

<div class="sidenote">RE-AFFORESTING ARAN.</div>

<p>To re-afforest the
disafforested wilderness has of late occupied the
thoughts of the thoughtful in our country. Dr.
Lyons, for some time M.P. for the city of Dublin,
gave to it much of his attention. He has been taken
away, but his mantle has fallen upon another. Dermot
O'Conor Donelan, Esq., J.P., of Sylane, near Tuam,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>teaches us how the people of other countries are
enriched by their forests. Having made a tour
through the unwooded mountains of Connemara, he
subsequently in the present year made a tour through
the wooded mountains of the Grand Duchy of Baden.
His inquiries and the result of his inquiries in
that prosperous country he published in a series of
letters in the <i>Irish Times</i> and <i>Freeman's Journal</i>.
To give those letters <i>in extenso</i>, however instructive,
would fill too many of our over-filled pages, but we
may be permitted to make a few quotations from
them.</p>

<p>"It is a noteworthy fact," writes Mr. Donelan,
"that from the class of lands similar to those that lie
waste in Ireland, the recent progress of Germany
is generally believed to proceed. Prussia, Bavaria,
Saxony, Wurtemburg, Baden, and Alsace-Lorraine have
a combined population of 40,644,000.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FORESTS IN BADEN.</div>

<p>The labour
connected with the forests of those countries and their
products have been estimated to be worth &pound;9,450,000;
and those earnings suffice for the maintenance of
about 300,000 families." He then forms a painful
contrast between Baden and Ireland&mdash;between the
German mountain districts, and the mountain districts
of the same kind in Ireland where there is a
similarity of soil; but there the similarity ends.</p>

<p>"The mountains and bogs of Connemara, with the
roots and remains of trees scattered everywhere<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
amongst them, are lying there in their bare and
melancholy desolation, and but for the presence of
some miserable hovels, the whole scene might be inside
the Arctic circle. The mountains of Schwartzwald,
however, are covered with forests of silver fir, and by
their vast supplies of timber are creating vast industries.
In a tour which I made through it some
months ago, I observed that almost every branch
of wood-work was in active operation, and for miles
together the rattle of machinery was hardly ever
silent.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FOREST INDUSTRIES.</div>

<p>The manufacture of paper from wood, which
is comparatively new, has already assumed very large
proportions in South-Western Germany. Second class
wood-ends, etc., for paper-making, can be had for
about eight shillings a ton; while straw must always
cost from 30<i>s.</i> to &pound;2 10<i>s.</i> This difference will
gradually transfer the manufacture of paper and papier-mach&eacute;
to this and similar forest districts. Within
the last few years several mills have been established
for the manufacture of cellulose from wood. They
have been found successful, and it is expected that
this will soon be among the most important of the
forest industries. A list of the objects of which
cellulose is the basis would form a curious example of
recent invention. In the American Patent Office no
less than one hundred and twenty patents have been
taken out in connection with cellulose since 1870.
Gun-cotton, collodion, celluloid, artificial ivory,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
handles for knives, etc; dental plates, cuffs, collars,
shoe-tips and in-soles, billiard balls, are a few names
taken from a long list, and which will give an idea of
the number of trades this one material is establishing
in many cities and towns of Germany. Celluloid can
be made as hard as ivory or be spread on like paint;
it is water proof, air proof, and acid proof. It can be
pressed or stamped, planed as wood, turned in a lathe,
and it can be transparent or opaque.</p>

<p>"I am not able to state the quantity of basket and
wicker-work used in the United Kingdom, but at
the lowest computation it must be several millions
worth a year, the imports alone being very large.</p>

<p>"It would not be possible to enumerate," he writes,
"the number of industries which supplies of timber
are capable of developing. Some of those would
spring up within twelve or fourteen years, and which
are further capable of enormous development. Poplar
grows rapidly in Ireland; in twelve years the thinnings
are of considerable size, and, according to Mr.
Herbert's report on the forestry of Russia (Blue Book,
commercial, 31, 1883), it appears that from poplar
most of the paper exported from Russia is manufactured.</p>

<div class="sidenote">RE-AFFORESTING ARAN.</div>

<p>The consumption of paper in the United
Kingdom must be over &pound;30,000,000 a year, and if it
be probable that mountain forests are likely to be the
scene of a considerable portion of its production in
the future, what an opportunity is there then of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
utilizing by means of forestry the waste lands and the
cheap labour of Donegal and Connemara. Ever
since 1800 the question of the waste lands has been
before the public. It was reported on in 1812, and
again by the Devon Commission of 1840. Every
writer on the industrial resources of Ireland had paid
it particular attention. It was mentioned by Sir
Richard Griffith, by Munns, by Dutton, and even
before 1800 by Arthur Young. There is hardly a
Government in Europe which has not undertaken the
work of reclaiming and afforesting waste lands."</p>

<div class="sidenote">FORESTS FORMERLY IN ARAN.</div>

<p>So writes the author of those interesting letters,
and he dissipates an illusion which is prevalent
amongst us, namely, that to turn planting into profit
requires long years and gross timber. On the contrary,
as his observations prove, in their earlier years
of growth forests will supply many industries for
which old timber is unsuited. A great objection to
re-afforesting mountains and rocky districts is the
length of time that is generally supposed must elapse
before so gigantic a work could become remunerative;
but Mr. O'Conor Donelan shows that no great length
of time is necessary, and that after a very few years
timber would be suitable for the works of which he
speaks. Would that the Government would take his
words to heart, and do in Ireland what German
statesmen have done in Germany! There are men
amongst us who would fain believe that Aran is too<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
much exposed to the westerly winds to admit of
timber being grown on the islands; but the great
roots old in the earth tell of the great trees that grew
in Aran many centuries ago.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">SUN-WORSHIP IN ARAN.</div>

<p>In the present chapter we propose to give a few of
the legends with which groves were enriched when
the worship of the sun (Baal) was the religion of the
world&mdash;legends yet remembered in Aran. In the
groves they offered sacrifices, and "burnt," writes
the Prophet Hosea, "incense under the oak and the
poplar and the turpentine tree [the pine], because
the shadow thereof was good."<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> And we are told

<div class="sidenote">WORSHIP OF BAAL IN ARAN.</div>

<p>The selection of such places originated, no doubt, in
the fact that the gloom of the forest was calculated
to excite awe, and because they considered that the
spirits of the departed hovered over the places where
the bodies were buried; and it was common to bury
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>the dead under trees, as appears from the eighth
verse of the thirty-fifth chapter of the Book of Genesis,
where it is stated that when Deborah, the nurse of
Rebecca, died, she was buried at the foot of Bethel
under an oak tree, and the name of that place was
called "The Oak of Weeping;" and when Saul, the first
King of Israel, fell at the battle of Gilboe, his bones
were buried under an oak tree at Jabesh.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Amongst
the Hebrews it was common, before the time of Moses,
to plant groves. But the idolatrous nations planted
them also; and groves and the places of idol-worship
soon became convertible terms. For the purpose,
therefore, of extirpating idolatry, the Lord thus spoke
through Moses: "Thou shalt plant no grove, nor
any tree near the altar of the Lord thy God."<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> And
in after-centuries, when Josias abolished the worship
of Baal in Judah, and destroyed them that offered
incense to the sun, and the moon, and to the twelve
signs, he caused the grove to be burnt there.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>Whether the groves of Aran were destroyed at the
time of the destruction of the religion of Baal and of
the introduction of Christianity, or in after-ages, it is
impossible now to state. That great trees had existence
in the islands in 1618 is certain, as appears by
a partly hereinbefore recited indenture of that date,
when Henry Lynch did demise a moiety of the three<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>

long term of years, excepting thereout <i>great trees</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">NYMPHS OF TREES.</div>

<p><i>The Oak.</i>&mdash;The chief object of worship was the

of a nymph, for the nymphs of trees, called in classics

trees which had been their abode, and with which they
had come into existence. Those that presided over
woods in general were called <i>Dryades</i>, as the divinities
of particular trees were Hamadryades. Not unfrequently
has the axe of the woodman been stayed by
the voice of the nymph breaking from the groaning
oak.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE OAK.</div>

<p>That misfortune was believed to follow in the footsteps
of those who wantonly felled an oak is abundantly
proved by the soothsayers in the olden time.
Often have oaks become attached to the lords of the
house with whose existence they were bound for
hundreds of years. If the leaves in a living state
have prophesied touching the affairs of men, so did
the dried timbers, as in the case of the <i>Argo</i>, when
they warned the Argonauts of the misfortunes that
awaited them. Not unfrequently has the falling of a
branch of the oak tree warned the protecting family
of coming disasters. The idols in idolatrous times
were manufactured from its wood, though more frequently
from that of the ash, and from it was cut the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
yule-log which served to maintain the perpetual fire.
Once a year all fires and lights but one were extinguished,
and that was the oaken log, from which
every other fire in the islands was with much ceremony
relighted.</p>

<p>The medicinal qualities of the tree, and the charmed
life it bore, prophetic, as we have said, and causing
diseases to depart by its spells and incantations, must
have made its existence, if it knew anything at all
about it, a happy one. The Irish of the "oak" is
<i>Dara</i>, and many an Aranite bears that name.</p>

<p>Now, there was a blessed Saint, "Mac Dara," who
lived in those islands long ages ago, and there was a
renowned statue of him made of oak, which the people
venerated with an idolatrous veneration. It was in vain
that the Catholic clergy called on them to desist from
kneeling before the graven image, and from swearing
on it rather than on the Book of the Gospels, on which
all men swore. Malachy O'Queely, Roman Catholic
Archbishop of Tuam, was, however, resolved to put
down an exhibition which he considered a scandal to
the Catholic Church, and so, coming to the islands in
1645, he tore down the statue and flung it into the sea;
but ill luck awaited him. In the same year he was
sent by the Supreme Council of Kilkenny to accompany
the confederate troops to Sligo, which had been lately
taken by the Parliamentary forces. He did so, and
the warrior archbishop rushed to the relief of the town,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
and for a season dislodged the enemy; but the tide of
victory turned, the Irish were routed, and the body of
the prelate was literally cut to pieces. Upon him
was found that treaty with Charles I. which afterwards
helped to bring the unhappy king to the
scaffold.</p>

<div class="sidenote">OAK&mdash;ASH.</div>

<p>Another of the superstitions that attaches to the
king of the forest is that, if his majesty leafs before
the ash, the coming season will be dry; if, however, the
ash leafs before the oak, then the coming season will
be wet.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 20em;">
"If the oak's before the ash,<br />
Then you'll only get a splash;<br />
If the ash precedes the oak,<br />
Then you may expect a soak."<br />
</p>

<p>Of the Irish oak and of the horror that insects have of
that tree, we may form an estimate from Hall, who, in
his Chronicles, says that "William Rufus builded Westminster
Hall, and the oaks with which the said Hall
was roof'd were felled in Oxmanstown Green, near
Dublin, and no spider webbeth and breedeth in that
roof of oak even to this day." Of the remote pedigree
of the oak we need not speak further than to remind
those who are curious about such matters that the
oak all over the world is said to be the first created
of all trees, and next to it comes the ash.</p>

<p>The <i>Ash</i> is "the Venus of the forest." On ashen
sticks (dreadful in matters of witchcraft, as appears<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
from the evidence given in the case of "the Dame
Alice Kettler," tried for witchcraft in Kilkenny, in
1324) witches were wont at night to ride "through
the fog and filthy air." To love-sick maidens the
even ash leaf&mdash;that is, where the leaflets of the leaf
are even in number&mdash;is of priceless value, "and
note that if a youngster meeteth and plucketh an
even ash leaffe and a four leaffed clover [shamrock],
they are most certaine to meet their husband or wyfe,
as the case may be, before the day passeth over;"
and so runs the old saw&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left:14em;">
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">"And if you find</span><br />
An even-leaved ash and a four-leaved clover,<br />
You'll see your true love 'fore the day is over."<br />
</p>

<div class="sidenote">ASH&mdash;ROWAN TREE.</div>

<p>Strange that the mountain ash, the <i>rowan tree</i>, should
be held in horror by witches. "Of it whip-handles
are made, for the bewitched and stumbling horses
thereby become unbewitched and unstumblers." So
also the housewife should, before turning the cows
out to grass for the summer, tie a switch of mountain
ash with a red worsted thread around the cow's tail.
The churn, so often bewitched of its butter, is certain
to withstand the evil eye when the churn-staff is
manufactured of the rowan tree. The roots of the
ash or the mountain ash, in Aran, are of rare
occurrence; we shall, therefore, pass on to the <i>aspen</i>,
of which it is said that it alone refused to bow, as
the other trees did, to the Redeemer, and that for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
such conduct the aspen leaf all over the world
trembleth even to this hour.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ELDER&mdash;PINE.</div>

<p><i>The Elder.</i>&mdash;The most unlucky of all trees is the
elder, now a mere bush; for out of it was made
the cross of Christ, and from one of its boughs
Judas hanged himself. In Scotland this tree is
known as the bourtree, and hence the rhyme&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left:20em;">
"Bourtree, bourtree, crooked wrung,<br />
Never straight and never strong;<br />
Ever bush and never tree,<br />
Since our Lord was nailed to thee."<br />
</p>

<p>The mushrooms growing in or near the elder are
known as Judas's ears, of wondrous virtue in curing
coughs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:20em;">
"For a cough take Judas' ear,<br />
With the parings of the pear;<br />
And drink this without fear."<br />
</p>

<p>The superstitions attached to this tree are many, and
to tell them would fill a volume.</p>

<p>Stumps of <i>Pine</i> and <i>Fir</i> are numerous in the Aran
islands. The fir tree has been ever highly esteemed.
It was amongst the materials employed in the building
of Solomon's temple. Together with the pine it was
held in such veneration in France, that St. Martin met
with the strongest possible opposition when he proposed
the destruction of the holy fir groves. The fir
grew luxuriantly in Palestine; and the Prophet Hosea
saith that the Lord will make Ephraim flourish "like<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
a green fir tree."<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> And another prophet, Ezechiel,
informs us, in the fifth verse of the twenty-seventh
chapter of his prophecy, that the navy of Tyre was
constructed of this tree, whilst the masts were from
the cedars (pines) of Libanus. It was the timber, too,
used for the manufacture of musical instruments in
Israel; for in the Second Book of Samuel (ch. vi. 5)
it is written that "David and all the house of
Israel played before the Lord on all manner of
instruments made of <i>fir wood</i>, even on harps, and
lutes, and timbrels, and cornets, and cymbals." And
when Hiram, King of Tyre, sent timber to Solomon
for the building of the temple, it was the cedar and
the fir<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> he sent, for which he was allowed twenty
thousand measures of wheat. It was, in Palestine, a
tall tree, on the tops of which, we are informed somewhere
in the Psalms, the storks built their nests.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HOLLY&mdash;IVY.</div>

<p>The <i>Holly</i>, or <i>Holy</i>, and the <i>Ivy</i> are indigenous in
the soil of Aran. In idolatrous times holly was
planted, according to Pliny, in the neighbourhood of
dwelling-houses, to keep away spirits and all manner
of enchantments. There can be no doubt that those
who believe dreams to be other than the wanderings
of the fancy can on any night have steady sensible
dreams of a reliable nature if they bring home in their
handkerchief (observing the strictest silence all the
time) nine leaves of thornless holly and place the same<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
under their pillow. Amongst the conversions of the
trees of the forest from the pagan to the Christian
faith, that of the ivy was the most remarkable; it no
longer adorns the brow of a drunken Bacchus, but is
now entwined in wreaths over the altar at the midnight
Mass on Christmas night. Nevertheless, they that
would look into futurity can still read in the ivy leaf
of what is coming to pass in after-times. Place a leaf,
on New Year's Eve, in a basin of water, and take it out
on the eve of Twelfth Night; if it come out fresh,
health is on the house; but if it come out spotted,
sickness and death are sure to follow.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HAWTHORN&mdash;BLACKTHORN.</div>

<p>The <i>Hawthorn</i> and <i>Blackthorn</i> grow freely in the
islands. Need it be told that the antipathy between
these shrubs is so great that the one is never found to
be growing naturally near the other? Of course, if
planted together, they will struggle on for a time; but
one or other generally sickens and dies; for there is a
controversy between them as to which had the misfortune
to supply the crown of thorns to Christ on the
night of the Passion. The peasantry in England,
Scotland, and France believe it was the hawthorn, and
they look on it as an outrage to bring in flowering
hawthorn in May to their houses, it being unlucky and
accursed ever since that dreadful night preceding the
Crucifixion. So also the blackthorn in Austria and
the south of Europe is considered unlucky; as it is
there insisted on that <i>it</i> supplied the thorns, wherefore<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
it is doomed to blossom when no other tree of the
forest dares, in the teeth of the poisonous Eurus, so to
do. On which side the truth lies we shall not venture
to speculate; but our astonishment is great when we
learn that the walking-stick of Joseph of Arimath&aelig;a
was of hawthorn, that in Glastonbury he stuck it
accidentally in the ground, and that ever since it and
its descendants bud, blossom, and fade on Christmas
Day!</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE ROSE&mdash;SILENCE.</div>

<p><i>The Rose.</i>&mdash;"I am the Rose of Sharon." In the
East it is the pride of flowers for fragrance and
elegance. It was used amongst the ancients in
crowns and chaplets at festive meetings and religious
sacrifices. A traveller in Persia describes two rose
trees fully fourteen feet high, laden with thousands
of flowers, and of a bloom and delicacy of scent
that imbued the whole atmosphere with the most
exquisite perfume. Originally it was white, and the
white moss-rose was suspended over the door of the
Temple of Silence; whence it is that secrets are said
to be told "under the rose." At convivial banquets in
Greece the guests not unfrequently wore chaplets of
roses, and anything said by them whilst wearing the
emblem of silence was not to be repeated. The white
rose was the emblem of purity, and the term "Mystical
Rose" is applied by the Catholic Church to the Virgin
Mary. Under the cross there grew, amongst the wild
flowers of Calvary, a multitude of white roses, some of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
which were reddened with the blood of Christ. From
these comes the red rose, emblematic, not alone of
purity, but of martyrdom.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE ROSARY&mdash;FERNS.</div>

<p>The tomb of the Virgin
(the Rose that never fades) was found by the apostles
to be filled with roses after the Assumption. Her
altars ever after have been decorated with roses, and
it was a high privilege in the Middle Ages to have a
garden where no other flower was admitted. These
gardens, called rosaries, may have suggested to St.
Dominic the name given to that collection of prayers
which he arranged, and which he called the Rosary.</p>

<p>The love of the nightingale for this flower is proverbial
in the East. It is unnecessary, of course, for
us to remind our readers that the white and red roses
were the badges of the rival houses of York and
Lancaster.</p>

<p>As for the elm and the beech, countless superstitions
are attached to these trees, but as we fail to
find that they existed in Aran, so we shall not prosecute
further our inquiries on this head.</p>

<p><i>Ferns.</i>&mdash;Not the least interesting amongst the
botanical curiosities of Aran are the ferns, that carry
their seed on their backs&mdash;a seed that has, it is said,
the extraordinary property of making the person in
whose shoes it is placed instantly invisible to all but
himself. So Shakespeare has it, too, in his play of
"<span class="smcap">1</span> Henry IV.," act ii. scene <span class="smcap">1</span>:</p>

<p>
"We have the receipt of fern seed, we walk invisible."<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">FERNS&mdash;INVISIBILITY.</div>

<p>A painful illustration of this property occurred, it is
told, when once upon a time a man was looking for a
foal that had strayed from his stable. He happened to
pass through a meadow just as the fern was ripened,
some of the seeds of which were shaken into his shoes.
After a wearisome and fruitless search during the night
he returned all travel-soiled in the morning, and sat
down in his house to join the family at breakfast. He
was amazed to see that neither wife nor children
welcomed him home, nor showed the slightest concern
at the night he had spent, nor even inquired about
the result of his search. At length, breaking silence,
he said, "I haven't found the foal." All were startled,
and they looked everywhere to see where he was
hiding. Believing that his family were treating him with
contempt, he repeated, in a towering passion, "I have
not found the foal!" They all sprang to their feet,
and his wife called him by name to give over that
nonsense, and to come out from his hiding-place. The
creaking of his shoes was distinctly heard, though the
wearer thereof could not be seen. At length, in
a voice of anger, he repeated, as he planted himself
opposite his wife at the foot of the table, "I say, I
have not found the foal!" Need we tell the terrors
of the family? But just then he remembered that he
had, on the previous night, crossed a meadow loaded
with ferns, and that some of the seed might have got
into his shoes, and that he was therefore invisible.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
Flinging them off, he at once became visible to
everybody.</p>

<p>Fern seed has also the valuable property of doubling
a man's power in the working field, several examples
of which are given by writers on this interesting
subject.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FAIRY FLAX&mdash;FAIRIES.</div>

<p>The <i>Fairy Flax</i> of Aran we have frequently spoken
of in the preceding pages, and that flax may be spun
from year's end to year's end, and little realized
thereby, unless, indeed, "the good people," as the
fairies are called,<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> take the spinner under their protection.
Now, there was once a man in humble circumstances,
who had an only daughter, the most
beautiful creature that ever was seen. She spent
much of her time spinning, but to no purpose. At
length a hideous dwarf, lame and blind of an eye,
came to her one day as she was spinning, and presented
her with a distaff full of flax, upon which, he
said, there was enough for her whole life, if she lived a
hundred years, provided she did not spin it quite off.
On she went spinning, but never spinning to the end,
and her loom produced the choicest of stuffs, for which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
she received prices almost fabulous! Day by day her
wealth increased, and after a time she felt assured that
the produce of her labour had now secured so sure a
market that it made little difference whether she spun
the fairy flax right off or not; so, to try what would
be the effect, in her curiosity she spun it to the end.
In a moment the wheel stopped, and she had ever
after to repent the curiosity that stripped her of
immense wealth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SATURDAY'S SPINNING&mdash;HEMP.</div>

<p>The spinning-wheel in Aran, the old crones say,
should never spin on Saturday. Whence this keeping
holy the Saturday I know not; but it does look as if
they who kept the Saturday holy, were of Israelitish
descent&mdash;were, perhaps, of the lost tribes carried into
Nineveh at the time of the Captivity by Salamanassar,
730 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>!<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> Now, there were two old women indefatigable
spinners, whose wheels never stood still, though
they were by the wise men warned not to spin on
Saturdays. At length one of them died, and on the
Saturday night following she appeared to the other,
who was as usual busy at the wheel, and showed her
her burning hand, saying&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left:18em;">
"See what in hell at last I've won,<br />
Because on Saturdays I've spun."<br />
</p>

<p><i>Hemp.</i>&mdash;I don't remember seeing hemp growing in
Aran to any great extent. Sowing the seed of hemp<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
on All Hallows' Eve in some parts of the country, and
on St. John's Night in others, is described in the
following lines from Gay's "Pastorals":&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left:18em;">
"At eve last midsummer no sleep I sought,<br />
But to the field a bag of hemp seed brought:<br />
I scattered round the seed on every side,<br />
And three times in a trembling accent cried,<br />
'This hemp seed with my virgin hand I sow,<br />
Who shall my true love be the crop shall mow.'<br />
I straight looked back, and, if my eyes speak truth,<br />
With his keen scythe behind me came the youth.<br />
'With my sharp heel I three times mark the ground,<br />
And turn me thrice around, around, around!"<br />
</p>

<div class="sidenote">HAZEL&mdash;DIVINING-RODS.</div>

<p>The <i>Hazel</i>, one of Thor's trees, is generally used as
a divining-rod to discover mines and lost treasures
supposed to be hidden underground. The person who
seeks for the treasure takes a hazel rod with an end in
each hand, and then slowly walks over the ground,
keeping the rod in a horizontal position before him;
when passing over the spot it bends down like a
bow in the middle, towards the place as if it were
magnetized, as the needle turns to the pole. Beyond
a doubt the hazel is known to miners, and to those
who look for minerals underground, as the divining-rod.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FAREWELL INISHMORE.</div>

<p>And now, bringing our legends to a close, we shall
bid farewell to these lonely and lovely isles, and in
bidding them farewell we shall merely ask how
it is that the travelling English public travel not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
into these islands, where frosts never wither, where
snows never rest? And so farewell to Inishmore, the

<div class="sidenote">O'BRIENS LORDS OF ARAN.</div>

<p>We have spoken so much in the foregoing pages of the
O'Briens, lords of Aran, that we feel inclined to say a
word as to, who those O'Briens were, whence they came,
and whither they went; and first, let us state that their
pedigree is traced by Irish genealogists to a date earlier
than the Christian era. The O'Briens, lords of Aran, were
descended from Bryan Boroimhe, King of Thomond and
monarch of all Ireland, who conquered and fell at the
battle of Clontarf on April 23, 1014, when the Danish
power, all over Ireland, was scattered to the four winds
of heaven. In the third generation after the death of
Bryan, his descendant Dermod sat on the throne of
Thomond, and this Dermod had sons and daughters,
and the eldest of the sons was called Turlough, who in
1118 became, on his father's death, King of Thomond,
whilst his younger brother was Mahon, and his youngest
brother was Teige; and the clan MacTeige for 470
years ruled those islands, we have no doubt, with a
very equitable and a very paternal rule, and wholly unhampered
with legislative bodies such as a Witenagemot,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
or with the parliamentary institutions of the Normans,
where the members then, as now, had the liberty of speaking,
sometimes very plainly, their minds&mdash;as, indeed,
the Norman name of our legislative assembly imports:
<i>parler-les-mens</i>, a place for "speaking their minds."
That the Corporation of Galway recognized the power of
the O'Briens, lords of the isles, is plainly told in the foregoing
pages, where we remember that twelve tuns of wine
were annually paid to the lord for sweeping the sea, as
it were with a broom, clean of the Algerine pirates that
then infested the high seas; and there can be little if any
doubt that the O'Briens were ready, from time to time and
at all times, to massacre the foe wherever they met him,
and to convert his ships to their own use and behoof in
manner and form as by their indenture of treaty was
provided. It is not for us to criticize with critical pen
the policy of the respected lord of the isles, who, in
1560, was swallowed up in the deep, near the Great
Man's Bay, when he was returning from Thomond loaded
with the booty which, at the point of the sword, he had
won from the subjects of his cousin O'Brien of Thomond;
for it does not appear that ties of blood preserved his
Majesty of Thomond from the vengeance of his lordship
the lord of the isles, or, <i>mutatis mutandis</i>, the lord of the
isles from the vengeance of his Majesty. "An eye for an
eye and a tooth for a tooth," was their maxim, and it may
have been good law where the antagonists had each two
eyes and two teeth; but the vengeance was dreadful
when the punished party had only one eye and one tooth.
He was then blinded and untoothed out and out; and
frequently such dreadful vengeance did await the conquered.
Let us not, however, be too hard on the conquerors

field.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> The O'Flaherties, an equally warlike race, dispossessed
the lords of the isles, and in 1588, the very year of
the Spanish Armada, Queen Elizabeth finally confiscated
their territories, and now the name of O'Brien is forgotten
in Aran. Not so on the mainland; the O'Briens are still
in Thomond and elsewhere, as, it is to be hoped, they
will be for centuries yet to come. The lords of the Isles
of Aran are extinct. The last of the male line was John
O'Brien of Moyvanine and Clounties, whose daughter
Sarah was married to Stephen Roche, from whom is
descended the present Thomas Redington Roche, of Ryehill,
Esq., J.P., Co. Galway. Amongst the families of
this house still existing in Thomond, are the noble house
of Inchiquin and the O'Briens of Ballynalacken, both of
whom trace up, in an unbroken succession, to Bryan
Boroimhe, who, like Leonidas at Thermopyl&aelig;, fell fighting
the foreign foe for the liberties of his country.</p>

<div class="sidenote">O'BRIENS LORDS INCHIQUIN.</div>

<p>The title of Inchiquin dates from the year 1543, but
no title was required to ennoble those who were of the
blood of kings, and were "nobler than the royalty that
first ennobled them." The untitled aristocracy in England
are often superior to the titled aristocracy, who cannot
trace back farther than the Wars of the Roses. Now,
the last King of Thomond resigned his royalty to Henry
VIII., who in return, by patent <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1543, bestowed upon
Murrough O'Brien, and upon the heirs male of his body,
the title of Baron of Inchiquin. This Murrough had two
sons, the elder Dermot, and the younger Donough, and
Dermot on his father's death became Baron of Inchiquin;
and so the title descended from father to son until the
year 1855, when James, the twelfth baron, who was
also seventh Earl of Inchiquin (creation <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1654) and
third Marquis of Thomond (<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1800), died without issue<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
male, when the earldom and marquisate expired. Thereupon
the father of the present baron, who was also a
baronet, and brother to William Smith O'Brien, celebrated
as Member of Parliament and leader of the Irish people,
knowing his descent from Donough, second son of the
first baron, instructed his counsel to bring his case before
the Committee of Privileges of the House of Lords, to
whose satisfaction he proved that he was heir male of
the body of the first baron, and thereupon he was confirmed
in said barony, and became thirteenth baron.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MARSHAL MACMAHON.</div>

<p>Let us now go back to Dermod, the third generation from
Bryan Boroimhe, which Dermod died, as we said, in 1118,
leaving three sons, the eldest Turlough, King of Thomond,
the younger Mahon, and the youngest Teige, lord of the
isles; from Mahon is sprung Marshal MacMahon, whose
acts and deeds are known of by all men.</p>

<div class="sidenote">O'BRIENS OF BALLYNALACKEN.</div>

<p>This Turlough, King of Thomond, was ancestor of
Teige O'Brien, who married Annabella, daughter of
Ulick McWilliam Burke, of Clanrickarde, known as
"Ulick of the Wine," and by her had, with other
sons, Turlough Don, King of Thomond in 1498, and
Donal. Turlough Don was ancestor of the family of Inchiquin,
of which we have spoken, and from Donal sprang
Turlough O'Brien, who was married to a grandniece of
Sir Toby Butler, better known as the jovial Sir Toby, the
great luminary of the Connaught Circuit, Solicitor-General
for Ireland under James II., and the celebrated lawyer
who drafted that treaty which will be remembered by all
generations as the broken Treaty of Limerick. Turlough
was the grandfather of John O'Brien, of Ballynalacken,
who died in 1855, and of James O'Brien, Esq., Q.C., who
was Member of Parliament for the city of Limerick from
1854 to 1858, when he was raised to a judgeship in the
Queen's Bench. It is too near our own time to speak of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
that learned lawyer further than to say that "he judged
not according to appearance, but judged just judgment;"
that in him the prisoner at the bar found a merciful judge,
and at the same time one who held the scales so that
crime could not escape with impunity. Let us hope that
when he went to a higher court he reaped the rewards
promised to a just judge; and let us hope that those who
come after him of his name and race may, when their
turn comes, follow in his footsteps, and thus show that
the wisdom of the wise still dwells in the brehons of
the Celtic race.</p>

<p>The Ballynalacken O'Briens are now represented
amongst the landed gentry by James O'Brien, J.P.,
D.L., and they are also represented at the Bar by his
brother, my learned friend, Peter, late Sergeant O'Brien,
now Solicitor-General for Ireland.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or

that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
